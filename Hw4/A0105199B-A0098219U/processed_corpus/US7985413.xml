microbiolog control in aqueou system microbiolog control is achiev by continu and inexpens dose water in contact with biofilm , or that come into contact with biofilm , use a highli effect biocid that provid veri effect microbiocid control of plankton microorgan and of biofilm speci , even where the biofilm infest have been in exist for long period of time and thu have encas themselv in a substanti quantiti of slimi defens polysaccharid layer or film . in addit , the biocid use make possibl signific reduct in copper and/or iron surfac in contact with the water as compar to n , n'-bromochloro-5,5-dimethyl hydantoin . still other advantag are made possibl by the describ technolog .
