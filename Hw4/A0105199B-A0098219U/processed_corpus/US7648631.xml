apparatu for wastewat treatment use nitrogen/phosphoru remov and floatat separ a method and an apparatu for wastewat treatment use a nitrogen/phosphoru remov process combin with a floatat separ of sludg that is replac by the graviti settl secondari clarifi are provid for effect remov organ substanc , nitrogen , phosphoru , granular substanc and the like from wastewat . al or fe electrod plate is use for gener the micro bubbl so that phosphoru is remov by al or fe ion dissolv from the anod . with the method and the apparatu , a concentr of the microorgan in the bioreactor is maintain high so that the volum and area of the reactor are reduc , that remov effici for organ substanc , nitrogen , phosphoru is increas , that deterior of settlabl due to sludg bulk or micro floc and deterior of out-flow water qualiti are prevent , that the time requir for settl is reduc to increas the process quantiti of wastewat , and that remov effici for phosphoru is maxim by simultan perform of biolog phosphoru remov and chemic phosphoru remov by chemic agglomer in the solid-liquid floatat separ vessel .
