process for treat nitrogen wastewat with simultan autotroph denitrif , hetertroph denitrif and cod remov a process for treat nitrogen wastewat contain an autotroph denitrif reaction , a heterotroph denitrif reaction and a cod remov reaction simultan and mixedli take place in a singl reactor . the nitrif reaction is caus by nitrifi bacteria , in which ammonium is oxid into nitrit . the autotroph denitrif reaction is caus by autotroph denitrifi bacteria , in which ammonium use as electron donor and nitrit use as electron acceptor are convert into nitrogen ga and nitrat . the heterotroph denitrif reaction is caus by heterotroph denitrifi bacteria , in which nitrat and cod are consum . it is not necessari to build two separ reactor for aerob nitrif and anaerob denitrif , therebi effect reduc the fabric and oper cost .
