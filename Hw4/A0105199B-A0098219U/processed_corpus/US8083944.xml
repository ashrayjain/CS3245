remov ammonia from wast water dure cold weather month describ herein is a submerg attach growth reactor ( sagr ) which provid nitrif ( ammonia remov ) from wastewat in cold to moder climat . the system describ herein is novel in that the sagr reactor includ more than one influent distribut point . specif , in addit to the first influent distribut point at the front end of the reactor , there is provid at least one addit distribut point ( s ) downstream of thi first distribut point for introduct of influent into the reactor . as a result of thi arrang , when a second low carbonac biochem oxygen demand ( cbod ) , high nitrogen influent is distribut into the reactor at a locat downstream of the initi influent entri point , a second ( or more ) popul of bacteria ( mainli nitrifi bacteria ) is establish and/or maintain in a physic discret part of the overal treatment reactor . thi second ( or more ) popul at a discret locat within the reactor is use in the remov of ammonia from high cbod influent when the reactor is expos to low temperatur .
