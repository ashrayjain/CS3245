method and apparatu for treat fluid a method and apparatu for treat a fluid to destroy , remov , or reduc undesir agent , such as microorgan , particl or ion , contain in the fluid and/or to inhibit the format of scale are disclos . the invent includ an apparatu for treat a fluid to destroy , remov , or reduc undesir agent , such as microorgan , particl , or ion , contain in the fluid and/or to inhibit the format of scale . the apparatu can includ an open fluid direct mean or conduit . the prefer open fluid direct mean is a conduit manufactur of resili , corrosion-resist materi . the apparatu is attach to a power sourc and ha a control mean . the control mean is desir a microprocessor and can includ a switch mean for regul the current to the apparatu . howev , simpler circuit and compon can be use for the control mean . the apparatu includ a field gener mean . the field gener mean form a treatment field . the treatment field is a magnet field and/or an electr field in an effect dose suffici to treat the fluid . the effect dose is determin by the exposur time ( s ) and strength ( s ) of the treatment field ( s ) and the concentr of contamin present in the fluid subject to the treatment .
