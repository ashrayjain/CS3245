osmot desalin process an energi effici desalin process that doe not produc wast product involv the extract of water from a first solut , such as seawat , by use a second concentr solut to draw the water from the first solut across a semi-perm membran . by manipul the equilibrium of the solubl and insolubl speci of solut within the second solut in favor of the solubl speci of the solut , a satur second solut can be use to gener osmot pressur on the first solut . also , by adjust the equilibrium in favor of the less solubl speci after the water ha been drawn from the first solut , a portion of the solut can easili be precipit out . heat the second solut decompos the solut into it constitu gass . the constitu gass and precipit solut may be recycl through the process to affect the chang in equilibrium and elimin wast product . addit , by use the wast steam from industri sourc and a heat pump to effect distribut heat through the present method , the present method exhibit greater energi effici than prior art method .
