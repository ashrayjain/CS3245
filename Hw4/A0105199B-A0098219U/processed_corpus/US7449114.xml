halogen solvent remedi method for enhanc bioremedi of ground water contamin with nonaqu halogen solvent are disclos . an illustr method includ ad an electron donor for microbe-medi anaerob reduct dehalogen of the halogen solvent , which electron donor enhanc mass transfer of the halogen solvent from residu sourc area into the aqueou phase of the ground water . illustr electron donor includ c.sub.2-c.sub.4 carboxyl acid and hydroxi acid , salt thereof , ester of c.sub.2-c.sub.4 carboxyl acid and hydroxi acid , and mixtur thereof , of which lactic acid , salt of lactic acid -- such as sodium lactat , lactat ester , and mixtur thereof are particularli illustr . the microb are either indigen to the ground water , or such microb can be ad to the ground water in addit to the electron donor .
