imag process method , imag process program , imag process devic , and imag devic an image-process method is character by includ a search oper of search for a local motion vector from each of block in the plural imag , an elect oper of elect a repres motion vector from the local motion vector of the respect block , and an approxim oper of approxim a motion vector distribut on the imag base on the repres motion vector in order to detect motion between plural imag with high precis without increas the number of block made by divid an imag . in addit , when an approxim surfac thereof is a plane , the oper amount for approxim the motion vector distribut and the inform amount for repres the motion vector distribut can be minim . |
