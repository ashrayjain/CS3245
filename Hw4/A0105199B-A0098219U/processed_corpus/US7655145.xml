contamin water treatment method and system for process of a liquid ( `` contamin liquid '' ) contain water and contain urin and/or other contamin in a two step process . urin , or a contamin liquid similar to and/or contain urin and thu have a rel high salt and urea content is pass through an activ carbon filter to provid a result liquid , to remov most of the organ molecul . the result liquid is pass through a semiperm membran from a membran first side to a membran second side , where a fortifi drink have a lower water concentr ( higher osmot potenti ) than the result liquid is posit . osmot pressur differenti caus the water , but not most of the remain inorgan ( salt ) contamin ( s ) to pass through the membran to the fortifi drink . option , the result liquid is allow to precipit addit organ molecul befor passag through the membran .
