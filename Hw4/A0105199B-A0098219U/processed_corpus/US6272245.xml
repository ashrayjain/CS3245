apparatu and method for pattern recognit featur character at least two signific portion or region of the print pattern on a model document are extract from a scanned-in imag of the model document . statist characterist of each signific region are calcul from the extract featur and save in a memori . in addit , geometr relationship , e.g . distanc and angl , between the region are also save in a memori . the geometr relationship are repres by the coordin of the region in a predetermin coordin system , e.g . the x-i coordin system correspond to the scan area on the platen of a scanner . when a new or trial document is scan and examin through a search window , featur are extract from the search window block and compar to the statist characterist of the model document previous store in memori . if there is a match , the coordin of the search window have the match featur in the trial document are record in a candid list . after the entir trial document ha been process , the geometr relationship between the window block on the candid list are compar with the geometr relationship of the match signific region block of the model document and if the relationship correspond the trial document is consid a match .
