apparatu and method for creat three-dimension caricatur the present invent relat to an apparatu and method for creat a three-dimension caricatur , and more particularli , to an apparatu and method for creat a three-dimension caricatur have a high degre of similar to user 's face by precis extract featur point inform on facial featur and modifi a three-dimension polygon face basic model base on the featur point inform use an asm techniqu special for face . the method compris the step of detect the posit of eye from an input facial imag and normal the size of the facial imag , detect each initi posit for facial featur from the normal facial imag , load asm in the normal facial imag so as to correspond to the detect initi posit and then extract featur point for the facial featur , and creat a three-dimension polygon face caricatur by modifi the three-dimension polygon face basic model accord to coordin valu of the extract featur point .
