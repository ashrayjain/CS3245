method and apparatu for flush contamin from a contain of fluid a contaminant-flush machin for remov contamin from a contain , such as an engin transmiss , air-condition coil , or transmiss cooler , which includ hose for coupl to the transmiss cooler and a pump for circul fluid through the hose and the transmiss cooler , and a fluid filter have a reduc tendenc toward caus vapor of the fluid . also includ in the contaminant-flush machin is an automat aerat system for inject air into the circul fluid at predetermin interv . addit , a revers flow pipe circuit is includ to permit automat and electr manipul of the flow direct of fluid through said transmiss cooler while at the same time not alter the direct of flow of fluid through the pump . the flow revers are repeat with a cycl of three ( 3 ) second in one direct follow by a flow in the other direct of one-fourth ( 1/4 ) of a second , therebi creat an overal flow of fluid primarili in one revers direct . the burst of air are less than one ( 1 ) second and occur at five ( 5 ) second interv .
