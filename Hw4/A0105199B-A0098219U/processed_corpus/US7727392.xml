system for convert kinet energi from brownian motion of gase or liquid to use energi , forc and work a system for produc energi includ a solvent chamber , a pressur chamber and a semi-perm barrier separ the solvent chamber from the pressur chamber . the solvent chamber for hold a solvent , and the pressur chamber hold a solut solut compris a solut dissolv in a solvent . the semi-perm barrier is permeabl to solvent molecul and imperm to solut molecul . solvent molecul effus across the semi-perm barrier into the solut solut of the close pressur chamber to increas the pressur of the pressur chamber , therebi gener energi in the form of hydrostat pressur . a convers devic may convert the increas pressur in the pressur chamber to energi . the solut solut may be expel and recycl after use .
