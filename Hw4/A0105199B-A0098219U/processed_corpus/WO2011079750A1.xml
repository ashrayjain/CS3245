batteri manag devic and portabl comput a batteri manag devic ( 1 ) and a portabl comput . the batteri manag devic ( 1 ) is use for manag a recharg batteri ( 3 ) dispos within the portabl comput . the portabl comput includ a charg circuit ( 2 ) for charg the batteri ( 3 ) . the batteri manag devic ( 1 ) includ a discharg circuit ( 14 ) for discharg the batteri ( 3 ) ; an obtain modul ( 11 ) for obtain a mode determin paramet ; a first determin modul ( 12 ) for determin whether or not to enter a batteri storag mode accord the mode determin paramet ; and a first control modul ( 13 ) for control the charg circuit ( 2 ) or the discharg circuit ( 14 ) in the batteri storag mode so that the power of the batteri ( 3 ) is control to be lower than a second power threshold . the perform of the batteri ( 3 ) which is store with it power lower than the second power threshold is better than the perform of the batteri ( 3 ) which is store with it power higher than the second power threshold . the batteri manag devic ( 1 ) can delay the deterior of the capac of the recharg batteri ( 3 ) within the portabl comput .
