metal organ framework -- polym mix matrix membran metal-organ framework ( mof ) -polym mix matrix membran ( mof-mmm ) have been prepar by dispers high surfac area mof ( e.g . irmof-1 ) into a polym matrix ( e.g . matrimid 5218 ) . the mof allow the polym to infiltr the pore of the mof , which improv the interfaci and mechan properti of the polym and in turn affect permeabl . pure ga permeat test show the incorpor of 20 wt- % of irmof-1 in matrimid 5218 polyimid matrix result in 280 % improv in co.sub.2 permeabl without a loss of co.sub.2/ch.sub.4 select compar to those of the pure matrimid 5218 membran . thi type of mof-mmm ha significantli improv ga separ perform with dramat high co.sub.2 permeabl ( > 35 barrer ) and higher than 29 co.sub.2/ch.sub.4 select at 50.degre . c. under 100 psig pressur , which are attract candid for practic ga separ applic such as co.sub.2 remov from natur ga .
