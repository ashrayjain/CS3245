agent for increas reject with a permeabl membran , process for increas the reject , permeabl membran and process for water treatment an agent for increas the reject with a permeabl membran which compris an ionic macromolecul have a weight-averag molecular weight of 100,000 or greater ; a process for increas the reject with a permeabl membran which compris treat a permeabl membran with the agent ; a permeabl membran which is treat in accord with the process ; and a process for water treatment which compris use the permeabl membran are disclos . by use the abov agent , an increas reject of inorgan electrolyt and organ compound solubl in water can be maintain for a long time easili and safe at the locat of the use of the membran without extrem decreas in the flux of permeat in the membran separ use a select permeabl membran such as a nano filtrat membran and a revers osmosi membran .
