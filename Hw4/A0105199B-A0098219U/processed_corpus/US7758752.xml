composit materi and method for remov harm algal bloom and turn them into submerg macrophyt the present invent propos a composit materi which can rapidli and effect remov alga and transform them into submerg macrophyt . the composit materi is a mixtur of two function materi : one can grow into submerg macrophyt , and the other is clay or modifi local soil particl which can floccul alga , inhibit phosphoru releas from sediment and act as the carrier of the above-ment seed , earthnut , bud , and root of submerg macrophyt . in addit , the present invent propos a physical-chemical-ecolog combin method for improv water qualiti and enhanc the ecolog restor of eutroph lake use the above-ment materi . by spray the composit materi to the lake surfac , the new method can remov alga and turbid through floccul and complet the plant process simultan so that hab and eutroph are effect control .
