vortex twin-fluid nozzl with self-clean pintl a nozzl for discharg fine atom fluid compris a vortex-mixing-modul with a mix chamber along with at least one liquid inlet tangenti commun with the chamber and at least one ga inlet axial commun with the liquid inlet prior to their inject into the mix chamber , wherein the mix fluid of liquid/ga from the liquid inlet is set vortex flow , re-mix with each other and form bubble-laden fluid . an imping member posit at the downstream of a substanti concentric-mount pintl stem of the modul provid the function of meter flow and form the spray angl while maintain the flow distribut to be axial-symmetr in both mass and veloc plu form a flow field with non-disturb angular momentum . a ga passag prepar in the pintl stem and exit to the downstream side of the deflector provid the featur of clean the pintl surfac , which elimin the coars drop on the pintl surfac , stop ani undesir residu hard layer from accumul , and provid surfac cool for requir high temperatur applic .
