low pressur mix apparatu for atom fluid the liquid feed injector as hereindescrib use sequenti stage of increas sever mix to fulli atom a liquid portion of a combin liquid and gaseou stream . sequenti mix consist of a first mild mix that take place in a mild mix zone and blend the liquid and gaseou materi into a substanti uniform mixtur . the uniform mixtur of liquid and gaseou materi pass through anoth stage of vigor mix where the liquid is shear and ga is dispers throughout the liquid by divid the mixtur into a plural of small stream and direct the project of the stream into imping with an impact medium to produc a homogen mixtur of fine ga bubbl dispers in the liquid . the homogen liquid and ga mixtur are then discharg through one or more discharg nozzl to effect atom and distribut of the liquid in a suspens of fluidiz solid . the sequenti stage of increas sever mix allow atom of the liquid into fine droplet with a reduc pressur drop across the discharg nozzl . in a highli prefer form , the liquid injector includ provis for inject two fluid stream into a suspens of fluidiz solid at two discret locat .
