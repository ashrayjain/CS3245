membrane-clean method for membran bioreactor process a method of clean a membran in a membran separ activated-sludg process . by the method , deposit adher to the surfac of a membran use in a membran separ activated-sludg process can be effect scratch off and the membran filtrat rate can be prevent from decreas . membrane-clean particl ( 4 ) in which the surfac to be in contact with the water to be treat ha been hydrophil and ha a surfac rough of 100-2,500 .mu.m are introduc into a bioreactor ( 1 ) . the particl are caus to flow by the lift effect of air bubbl eject from an aerat ( 3 ) or by the fluidiz effect of a fluidiz mean to therebi caus the particl to scratch off deposit adher to the surfac of a separ membran element ( 2 ) . in one embodi , membrane-clean particl ( 4 ) which are non-por or have close cell are use . in anoth embodi , membrane-clean particl ( 4 ) have an antibacteri ingredi , such as copper or silver , support on the surfac or in inner part thereof are use . in a still anoth embodi , the membrane-clean particl ( 4 ) are period brought into an anaerob condit to remov microorgan from the particl surfac .
