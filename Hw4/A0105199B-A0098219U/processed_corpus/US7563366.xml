system for remov bod and suspend solid through an activ sludg process and a ballast floccul process a method and system for treat water or wastewat to remov both solubl bod and suspend solid . the method entail direct first and second water or wastewat stream to a treatment system includ an activ sludg system and a ballast floccul system . the first water or wastewat stream is direct to the activ sludg system which includ at least one reactor and a clarifi . the second water or wastewat stream is direct to a ballast floccul system . mix liquor or activ sludg is direct from the activ sludg system to a mix chamber that is locat upstream from the ballast floccul system . the water or wastewat of the second stream is mix with the mix liquor or activ sludg in the mix chamber . the mix liquor from the mix chamber is direct to and through the ballast floccul system . in the end , the solubl bod in the second water or wastewat stream is reduc and suspend solid in the water or wastewat are also reduc .
