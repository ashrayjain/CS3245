electrolyt cell the present invent relat to a process of treat contamin water contain microorgan compris feed a contamin water stream at a volumetr flow of about 1 to about 1000 m.sup.3/h through an electrolys zone , said water stream have a conduct from about 0.0001 to about 100 s/m , electrolys said water stream in said electrolys zone defin by at least one electrod pair enabl treatment of microorgan , said at least one electrod pair compris an anod and a cathod without separ mean , said water stream be guid substanti perpendicularli through said at least one anod and cathod while impos a voltag across said anod and cathod and suppli a direct current to said anod and cathod , withdraw from the electrolys zone a treat water stream . the invent also relat to an electrolyt cell in which said process can be perform , and to the use of the electrolyt cell .
