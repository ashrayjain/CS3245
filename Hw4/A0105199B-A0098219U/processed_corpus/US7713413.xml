aerat anox membran bioreactor a process for treat biolog oxygen demand ( bod ) , nitrogen and phosphoru contain wastewat , wherein the process includ provid wastewat influent to an oxygen-deficit aerat zone have activ sludg and mix the wastewat influent with the activ sludg in the oxygen-deficit aerat zone to form a mix liquor . the process further includ transfer the mix liquor from the oxygen-deficit aerat zone to an oxygen-surplu aerat zone and transfer a portion of the mix liquor from the oxygen-surplu aerat zone to a membran filter wherein a filtrat is separ from sludg . in addit , the process includ recycl at least a portion of the sludg to the oxygen-deficit aerat zone as recycl activ sludg .
