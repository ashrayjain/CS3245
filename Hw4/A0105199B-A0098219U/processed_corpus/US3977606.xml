diffus devic a diffus devic for use in dissemin air or other gaseou fluid under pressur character by wall structur at least a portion of which is form of imperm materi have a multitud of normal seal microscop ruptur . said wall structur , at least in the area of said ruptur , is character by the abil to flex when the interior wall surfac thereof , which defin the diffus chamber , is fill with air or other gaseou fluid under a predetermin level of pressur . said ruptur are so design that as long as the requir air pressur is maintain they form a multitud of jet-lik flow passag each of which ha an exceedingli small diamet . consequ , as long as the pressur level is maintain , the air will move from the diffus chamber , by way of said microscop ruptur , in the form of a multitud of veri fine , rel minut , air jet which on entri to a surround bodi of liquid , for exampl , will form air bubbl which are correspondingli of extrem small , rel micro-miniatur size . the materi of the diffus wall structur is such that , when the air pressur fall below the requir level , the microscop ruptur will automat reseal . prefer embodi of the invent are distinguish by the diffus wall structur be compris in part by an integr frame the respect end portion of which form end wall and are space by a rel narrow integr connect strip which is apertur and ha a trough-lik form .
