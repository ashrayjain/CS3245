process for recov organ compound from aqueou stream contain same a method for a liquid-liquid extract of hydrophil organ compound from aqueou solut thereof is describ . the method gener includ intermix a suffici quantiti of a specifi glycol ether with the aqueou liquor at a first temperatur to form a suspens compris an aqueou raffin phase and a glycol ether extract phase ; separ the glycol ether extract phase from the aqueou raffin phase ; heat the glycol ether extract phase to a second , higher temperatur to form a suspens compris an aqueou extract phase contain a portion of the hydrophil organ compound and a glycol ether raffin phase ; and separ thi glycol ether raffin phase from the aqueou extract phase . the select glycol ether ha an invers solubl in water and the partit ratio , valu k , for the hydrophil organ compound is greater than 0.1 . thi method is use for recov valuabl hydrophil organ acid produc via ferment or produc or use in variou manufactur process .
