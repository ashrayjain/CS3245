method of dechlorin treatment of flow water , in particular upstream of a biolog pollut detector a select method of dechlorin treatment of circul water contain disinfect chlorin in the form of clo.sup.- , hclo , clo.sub.2 or chloramin , where an ascorb acid aqueou solut is inject from a storag reservoir into the water flow , the mass flow rate of the inject ascorb acid solut be regul with respect to the mass flow rate of the chlorin in the circul water to be treat , in such a way that the ratio ( r ) of the ascorb acid and chlorin mass flow rate ( r=d1/ d2 ) is between 2.5 and 4 , prefer less than or equal to 3 . the method can be use for treatment of water that feed into a biolog detector contain a disinfect chlorin content that is incompat with the surviv of the biolog speci use in the detector . the disinfect chlorin level in the circul water after mix is maintain at a valu lower than or equal to 0.6 mg/l , and prefer lower than or equal to the detect limit .
