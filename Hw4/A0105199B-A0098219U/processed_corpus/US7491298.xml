plant for produc low deuterium water from sea water a plant and process for effici product of low deuterium water from seawat . the plant includ a solar still with a black pan for collect solar heat , that vapor portion of the seawat and a porou slope membran posit over the black pan to collect and condens the vapor and to direct the condens via graviti to a condens tank . the condens water is separ into it atom compon , hydrogen and oxygen , in an electr ; then the hydrogen and oxygen are combin in a reactor to produc heat and low deuterium water . in prefer embodi the reactor is a fuel cell which in addit to the heat and water also produc electr . at least a portion of the heat produc in the reactor is use in the solar still to assist in the vapor of the seawat and to greatli increas the effici of the still .
