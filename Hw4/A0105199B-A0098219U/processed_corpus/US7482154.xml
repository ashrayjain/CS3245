diamagnet forc field bioreactor the invent is an apparatu compris a magnet adapt to creat a diamagnet forc field at all point in space at which a magnet field-field gradient product of the magnet ha a valu greater than or equal to a threshold valu . at or abov the threshold valu , the diamagnet forc field induc a diamagnet bodi forc within a biolog specimen support within a bioreactor chamber that is dispos within the diamagnet forc field . the apparatu may alter the magnitud of the induc diamagnet bodi forc and may alter the direct of the induc diamagnet bodi with respect to a spatial coordin system or with respect to the direct of a secondari bodi forc act upon or within the biolog specimen , therebi alter the vector sum of the induc diamagnet bodi forc and the secondari bodi forc act on the biolog specimen .
