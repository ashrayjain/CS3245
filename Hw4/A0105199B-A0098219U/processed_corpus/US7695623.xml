system and method for enhanc an activ sludg process a system for enhanc an activ sludg process that includ at least one aerat tank subsystem for receiv a flow a wastewat and for introduc dissolv oxygen to a popul of microorgan to promot growth of biolog floc in a mix liquor defin by a concentr of mix liquor suspend solid . a weight agent impregn subsystem includ an impregn tank for mix the mix liquor , virgin weight agent , and recycl weight agent to impregn the weight agent into biolog floc suspend in the mix liquor to form weight biolog floc . a floccul inject port locat downstream from at least one aerat tank for introduc a floccul to the mix liquor for enhanc settl and thicken of the weight biolog floc and for provid agglomer of non-impregn biolog floc and/or partial impregn biolog floc with weight biolog floc . at least one clarifi separ and collect the weight biolog floc from the mix liquor to provid a secondari effluent and a settl sludg . a return activ sludg subsystem recycl the major of the settl sludg to the at least one aerat tank . a weight agent recoveri subsystem remov and shear the remain settl sludg and recov the weight agent therefrom and reintroduc the weight agent to the at least one aerat tank . a wast subsystem wast the remain sludg of the weight agent recoveri subsystem to control the popul of the microorgan in the mix liquor .
