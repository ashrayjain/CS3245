megason clean system with buffer cavit method a wafer clean method and system includ a combin high frequenc signal , a low frequenc signal , and in one embodi a bias voltag signal , allow clean particl and impur off of fine-structur wafer , through applic of an acoust field to the wafer through a clean liquid which foster micro-bubbl format for effect clean while buffer micro-bubbl growth which would otherwis damag the wafer .
