wastewat purif system an object of the present invent is to provid a control method , for a wastewat purif system , where the statu of a wastewat purif system employ a batch activ sludg process is accur understood by analyz the data waveform of do , orp and ph . in the control method for a wastewat purif system , an aerat devic is control by a programm sequenc , a control acquir respect data waveform from a first sensor , a second sensor and a third sensor and the control statu data of the programm sequenc , the control analyz the data waveform of dissolv oxygen concentr from the first sensor , the data waveform of oxidation-reduct potenti from the second sensor , and the data waveform of hydrogen ion concentr from the third sensor , and the control perform an alarm process when a deviat from a previous fix normal state is discov as a result of the analysi .
