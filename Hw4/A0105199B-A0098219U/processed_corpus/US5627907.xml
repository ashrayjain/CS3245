computer detect of mass and microcalcif in digit mammogram method and apparatu for detect abnorm region such as mass and microcalcif in live tissu depict in radiograph such as mammogram is present by digit the radiograph to produc a digit radiograph , and , by comput , identifi , accord to predetermin criteria , ani suspect abnorm region ; and for each identifi suspect abnorm region , extract multipl topograph layer of the region from the digit radiograph ; and evalu the extract multipl topograph layer ' abnorm region to determin whether the region is an abnorm region ; and display the abnorm region in a version of the radiograph . layer are extract by threshold the digit radiograph at a particular threshold valu for each topograph layer . the threshold valu for each other layer is base on the threshold and contrast valu in a previou layer .
