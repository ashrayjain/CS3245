anaerob digest process for low-solid wast an anaerob digest process for the treatment of domest wastewat sludg that requir less space and fund to construct . sludg to be treat is combin with recycl anaerob digest sludg to form a blend sludg . the recycl anaerob digest sludg provid a sourc of microorgan necessari to initi the breakdown of organ matter in the sludg to be treat . the sludg is then concentr to increas total solid content to about 10-20 % . excess liquid is remov from the concentr sludg . the concentr sludg is then digest in an anaerob reactor system such as a plug-flow reactor . some benefit of the system 's reduc volum , as a result of concentr of the sludg , includ elimin of the necess of substanti continu stir and the new possibl for the type of construct to be use for the reactor . in addit to the reduc cost of the process itself , the process creat bioga that can be use to offset energi requir for the process .
