process to improv the effici of a membran filter activ sludg system a process for treat bod , nitrogen and phosphoru contain wastewat , wherein the process includ provid wastewat influent into an anaerob zone have activ sludg and mix the wastewat influent with the activ sludg in the anaerob zone to form a mix liquor . the process further includ provid the mix liquor into an oxygen-deficit aerat zone and recycl denitrifi mix liquor from the oxygen-deficit aerat zone to the anaerob zone for mix therein with wastewat . in addit , the process includ transfer the mix liquor from the oxygen-deficit aerat zone to an oxygen-surplu aerat zone and transfer a portion of the mix liquor from the oxygen-surplu aerat zone to a membran filter wherein a filtrat is separ from sludg . the process also includ recycl at least a portion of the sludg to the oxygen-deficit aerat zone as recycl activ sludg .
