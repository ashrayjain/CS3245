carbon dioxid stimul of nitrif in activ sludg reactor a method of stimul nitrif at low srt by elev pco.sub.2 dure aerat is disclos . the improv on solid settl perform when elev pco.sub.2 wa suppli after 2 hour within the react cycl is consist with the previou result that identifi inorgan carbon as a potenti remedi to poor settl and bulk sludg problem in activ sludg system . elev pco.sub.2 increas the concentr of carbon dioxid and lower the ph , which improv nitrif . the specif growth rate of nitrifi bacteria is sensit to pco.sub.2 , ph , and dissolv oxygen ( do ) . the do is a function of the aerat rate . elev the pco.sub.2 and lower the aerat rate provid condit for nitrif rate that are compar to convent system . howev , the lower aerat rate yield signific energi cost save .
