micro ga attend system a lagoon of effluent is establish , compris a set of sub-port at differ level in the lagoon associ with a correspond set of concentr of dissolv oxygen , each sub-port of the lagoon have a differ concentr of dissolv oxygen . an incub compris a set of sub-port associ with said set of concentr of dissolv oxygen is establish , each sub-port of the incub have a differ concentr of dissolv oxygen . a volum of effluent from each sub-port of the lagoon is transmit to a correspond sub-port of an incub have a substanti similar concentr of dissolv oxygen as said sub-port of the lagoon . a first remedi volum of effluent is gener in said correspond sub-port of the incub respons to prolifer a first microorgan which use a first compound in said volum of effluent as substrat for growth , the first microorgan enabl a first chemic reaction which alter the first compound .
