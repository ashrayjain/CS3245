superson nozzl a method of convers of a single-phas stream into a superson homogen two phase medium includ flow the stream into an inlet section of a nozzl at an initi pressur , boil a portion of the liquid medium by acceler a veloc of the stream through a multistag draw-down of an inner diamet of the inlet of the nozzl to form a mixtur of liquid and boil fluid ; and acceler the mixtur to a second veloc by flow the mixtur through an outlet section that diverg along the flow direct . the outlet section includ a concav portion , a convex portion , and a transit between the concav portion and the convex portion in which the concav profil smoothli transit to the convex profil . a veloc of the stream is equal to a veloc of sound in the stream at a critic section locat in the outlet section .
