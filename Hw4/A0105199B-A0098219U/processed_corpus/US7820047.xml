integr multi-zon wastewat treatment system and method a wastewat treatment system ha two separ but interlink tank contain four differ zone , name aerob , microaerophil , anox and anaerob , for the biolog treatment of the wastewat , as well as two clarif zone and a filtrat unit for separ of solid from liquid . the first tank contain the aerob , microaerophil and anox zone as well as a clarif zone , while the second dank includ the anaerob zone , a solid-liquid separ zone and a filtrat unit . the aerob zone is an airlift reactor that contain air diffus at the bottom of the zone to introduc air into the zone . the air bubbl mix the liquid and it content of microorgan , and provid oxygen for the aerob biolog process that take place in thi zone . aerat also produc circul of liquid between the aerob zone and it adjac microaerophil and anox zone that are locat at the side and under the aerob zone , respect . the aerob zone contain suspend microorgan of heterotroph and autotroph group that grow insid the circul liquid , known as mix liquor . within the volum of the aerob zone , loos carrier materi or stationari object are dispos to support the attach of microbi biomass and the format of microbi biofilm .
