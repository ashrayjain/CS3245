instal use to obtain salt-fre sea water at a low temperatur with continu oper and enthalpi recoveri a sea water desalin instal that employ an evaporation-condens system which oper continu at a low temperatur and which enabl the recoveri of energi releas . the instal includ a cylindr evapor have a larg evapor surfac and a concentr condens with a larg surfac area . sea water is use to cool the condens and said water is subsequ sent to the evapor . a static high-pressur ventil is use to : ( i ) drive the vapor/air in a close circuit between the evapor and the condens and ( ii ) , use a calibr nozzl , creat a pressur gradient that is equival to the pressur of the satur vapor at work temperatur between said two zone . the aforement evapor and condens are thermal insul in relat to one anoth and to the extern environ .
