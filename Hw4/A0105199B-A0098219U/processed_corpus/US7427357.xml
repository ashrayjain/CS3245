process and apparatu for anaerob treatment of sulfur compound-contain wastewat an object of the present invent is to provid a process for a high-perform upflow anaerob sludg treatment ( methan ferment treatment ) target an organ wastewat contain an inorgan sulfur compound and an apparatu therefor . the invent relat to a process for methan ferment treatment of an organ wastewat contain a sulfur compound , which includ : detect a concentr of hydrogen sulfid in a bioga gener from a step of methan ferment treatment ; and , conduct a control of subject the organ wastewat to a desulfur treatment oper in the case that the concentr of hydrogen sulfid in the bioga exce a predetermin valu , and to an apparatu therefor . it is prefer that the predetermin valu of the concentr of hydrogen sulfid is from 1 to 4 % , prefer from 1 % to 2 % , and the desulfur treatment oper compris ad a desulfur agent contain an iron ion so that a molar ratio of the iron ion to sulfur is from 0.05 to 1 .
