substrat spin treat method and apparatu a baffl is place in a posit oppos to discharg open of a treat solut suppli nozzl and between the discharg open and the surfac of a substrat . the baffl intercept a treat solut discharg from the discharg open , wherebi the treat solut is suppli evenli to the surfac of the substrat by flow over a surfac of the baffl and fall from an edg of the baffl to the substrat , instead of fall from the discharg open directli to the substrat . no microbubbl are form in the treat solut on the substrat , which would caus an uneven of treatment . the discharg open may be defin by a plural of circular bore form in the suppli nozzl . each circular bore may have a diamet at least equal to a space between an adjac pair of circular bore .
