water treatment method the present invent provid a physic water treatment ( pwt ) method and apparatu to treat liquid coolant . electrod ( 22 , 24 ) are provid in a coolant stream ( 21 ) , and an altern voltag is appli across the electrod ( 22 , 24 ) to produc an electr field through the coolant . the altern voltag creat an oscil electr field in the coolant that promot the collis of dissolv miner ion . the ion collid to form seed particl that precipit out of solut . bulk precipit of seed particl decreas the avail of ion in solut which can crystal on heat transfer surfac . the seed particl adher to addit ion that separ out of solut and form larger particl that may be remov from the coolant stream ( 21 ) use a varieti of treatment measur . in addit to precipit miner ion , the electr field may be appli to destroy bacteria , alga and microorgan that accumul in the coolant stream ( 21 ) .
