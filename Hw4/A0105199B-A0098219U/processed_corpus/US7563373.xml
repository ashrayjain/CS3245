remov of phosphor from wastewat process , method and system are provid herein for lower the concentr of phosphoru in wastewat . the process includ ad a suitabl amount of an aluminum-bas coagulant/floccul , for exampl , an aluminum-sil coagulant/floccul product to the wastewat while maintain the ph of the wastewat at between about 4.5 and about 6.65 . thi step provid an eventu effluent stream of precipit aluminum-bas , phosphorus-contain floc dispers in the wastewat . the next step involv physic remov , as by filter , the precipit aluminum-bas , phosphorus-contain floc which is dispers in the wastewat . these step are abl to provid a wastewat effluent contain less than about 0.03 mg total phosphoru per liter of wastewat . the disclosur also teach novel method and system for carri out the novel process .
