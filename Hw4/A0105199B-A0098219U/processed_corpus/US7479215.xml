mediat electrochem oxid of halogen hydrocarbon wast materi a mediat electrochem oxid process is use to treat , oxid and destroy halogen hydrocarbon wast materi . the wast materi are introduc into an apparatu for contact with an electrolyt contain the oxid form of one or more revers redox coupl , at least one of which is produc electrochem by anod oxid at the anod of an electrochem cell . the oxid form of ani other redox coupl present are produc either by similar anod oxid or reaction with the oxid form of other redox coupl present and capabl of affect the requir redox reaction . the oxid speci of the redox coupl oxid the halogen hydrocarbon wast molecul and are themselv convert to their reduc form , whereupon they are reoxid by either of the aforement mechan and the redox cycl continu until all oxidiz wast speci , includ intermedi reaction product , have undergon the desir degre of oxid .
