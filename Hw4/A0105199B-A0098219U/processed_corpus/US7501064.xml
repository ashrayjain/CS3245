integr electro-pressur membran deioniz system an integr treatment system use electrodialysi and pressure-driven membran for deioniz and decontamin liquid to a near-pur qualiti for use or reus in industri or municip oper . the integr system includ step of pre-filt contamin feed liquid blend the filter liquid in prepar for treat the mix liquid in parallel or sequenti treatment step util nanofiltr or revers osmosi , proceed by or follow by an integr electrodialysi treatment . a control mean select direct mix liquid to each of the treatment unit for treatment in parallel or in seri depend on the conduct and residu contamin in the mix liquid . in comparison with nanofiltr or revers osmosi onli system , or electrodialysi onli system , the integr system provid improv effici for treatment , requir less energi to oper , and reduc mainten and capit cost .
