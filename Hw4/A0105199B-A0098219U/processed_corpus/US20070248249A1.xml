fingerprint identif system for access control a one-to-mani identif system for access control allow a search rate of up to .about.1:30,000 in a real time . the system use a veri fast pattern base screen algorithm follow by a fast minutia base screen algorithm . a fuse score of both algorithm is use as a decis metric to screen out a vast major of all the templat after the second stage . the remain templat are sent to a full minutia base algorithm to obtain a minutia comparison score . if the result is still inconclus after the third stage , a full pattern base algorithm is run , and it score is fuse with the minutia comparison score . the system also use an adapt classif techniqu which minim a distanc between each templat and a number of templat . the system can be realis as a standalon unit or on a server .
