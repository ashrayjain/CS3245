imag retriev system and method use imag histogram an imag retriev system and method use an imag histogram for determin central point and dispers valu as well as quantiti inform of color about respect histogram bin , therebi use these as map inform for imag retriev . the imag retriev method use an imag histogram includ the follow step . a first step of comput an imag histogram bin when an imag is input , and accumul valu of x , y , x.sup.2 , y.sup.2 to comput central point and dispers valu . a second step of normal the respect central point and dispers valu through divid these by size of whole imag , and store these . a third step of gener a valu of model to be retriev by draw a featur vector when a queri imag is input , and comput the differ between the gener valu of model and central point and dispers valu of an imag histogram , count , and number of correspond bin within the data store in the second step . a fourth step of specifi a similar valu of an imag use the valu comput in the third step .
