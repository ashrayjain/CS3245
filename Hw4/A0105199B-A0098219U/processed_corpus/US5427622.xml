method for uniform clean of wafer use megason energi apparatu and method for cleaning/etch the surfac of an articl with sonic energi in the megahertz rang which employ an anti-reflect mechan within a recircul tank . a tank have at least one side wall and a bottom structur hold a cleaning/etch liquid and a megason transduc is associ with the tank for project megason energi into the liquid . the anti-reflect mechan is dispos within the tank in close associ with the at least one sidewal or bottom structur of the tank to therebi minim reflect of megason energi from the associ surfac . prefer , the megason transduc is associ with a first tank sidewal which oppos a second tank sidewal , and the anti-reflect mechan is dispos adjac the second tank sidewal . by way of exampl , the anti-reflect mechan can compris a stream of ga bubbl , a plural of anecho structur , or a combin of both ga bubbl and anecho structur .
