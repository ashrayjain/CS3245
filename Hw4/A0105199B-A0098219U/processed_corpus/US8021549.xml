method and apparatu for produc potabl water from seawat use forward osmosi a method and apparatu for desalin seawat which use an ammonia bicarbon forward osmosi desalin process . seawat is pump through one side of a membran assembl . a draw solut is pump through the other side of the membran assembl . the draw solut withdraw water molecul from the seawat through the membran into the draw solut . a draw solut separ receiv a heat draw solut which then decompos into ammonia , carbon dioxid and water . potabl water is separ from ammonia ha and carbon dioxid ga . the ammonia ga and carbon dioxid ga are recombin with a portion of the potabl water stream to reform the ammonium bicarbon draw solut .
