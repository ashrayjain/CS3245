radiograph imag detector and radiograph imag gener system provid are a portabl radiograph imag detector capabl of transmit with a smaller number of transmiss the read result of dark read perform a plural of time when an offset calibr or the like is carri out , and a radiograph imag gener system use the portabl radiograph imag detector . the portabl radiograph imag detector ( 1 ) compris : a sensor panel ( 4 ) in which a plural of radiat detector element ( x , y ) are dispos in a two-dimension shape ; a storag mean ( 7 ) for store dark read valu ( d.sub.k ( x , y ) ) output from the radiat detector element ( x , y ) under the condit that radiat is not irradi ; a calcul mean ( 6 ) for calcul the offset correct valu ( o ( x , y ) ) for each of the radiat detector element ( x , y ) , base on a plural of dark read valu ( d.sub.k ( x , y ) ) obtain from the output of the radiat detector element ( x , y ) at everi dark read of a plural of time of dark read perform in advanc ; a commun mean ( 3 , 13 ) for transmit the offset correct valu ( o ( x , y ) ) for each of the radiat detector element ( x , y ) to an extern devic ; and a built-in batteri .
