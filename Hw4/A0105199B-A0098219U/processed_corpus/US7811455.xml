remov of ammonia from ferment effluent and sequestr as ammonium bicarbon and/or carbon a method for the remov and sequestr of ammonia nitrogen from anaerob ferment effluent while produc a higher btu bioga . the method includ the step of remov the slurri from the digest , strip the ammonia from the slurri or portion thereof with a high btu bioga , blend the strip ammonia with the digest bioga to remov the carbon dioxid and precipit ammonium bicarbonate/carbon as a solid while produc a high btu bioga , a portion of which is use to strip the ammonia and co.sub.2 from the slurri . the process remov ammonia nitrogen from the digest effluent while produc a high btu bioga and a solid ammonium bicarbonate/carbon product . ammonia strip is accomplish with a recycl strip ga defici in co.sub.2 and ammonia that is capabl of remov the co.sub.2 and ammonia from solut by virtu of the lower partial pressur of co.sub.2 and ammonia in the strip unit .
