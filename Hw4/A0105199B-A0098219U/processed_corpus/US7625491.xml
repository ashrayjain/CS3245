cyclic aerat system for submerg membran modul an aerat system for a submerg membran modul ha a set of aerat connect to an air blower , valv and a control adapt to altern provid a higher rate or air flow and a lower rate of air flow in repeat cycl . in an embodi , the air blower , valv and control , simultan provid the altern air flow to two or more set of aerat such that the total air flow is constant , allow the blower to be oper at a constant speed . in anoth embodi , the repeat cycl are of short durat . transient flow condit result in the tank water which help avoid dead space and assist in agit the membran .
