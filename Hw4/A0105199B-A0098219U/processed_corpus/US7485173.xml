cross-link and cross-link mix matrix membran and method of make the same the present invent is for novel high perform cross-link and cross-link mix matrix membran and the use of such membran for separ such as for co.sub.2/ch.sub.4 , h.sub.2/ch.sub.4 and propylene/propan separ . more specif , the invent involv the prepar of cross-link and cross-link mix matrix membran ( mmm ) . the cross-link mmm were prepar by incorpor micropor molecular siev or solubl high surfac area micropor polym ( pim ) as dispers micropor filler into a continu cross-link polym matrix . the cross-link mmm were prepar by uv-cross-link the cross-link mmm contain cross-link polym matrix such as bp-55 polyimid . pure ga permeat test result demonstr that both type of mmm exhibit higher perform for co.sub.2/ch.sub.4 and h.sub.2/ch.sub.4 separ than those of the correspond cross-link and cross-link pure polym matric .
