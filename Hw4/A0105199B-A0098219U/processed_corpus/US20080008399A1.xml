three-dimension shape estim system and imag gener a 3d shape estim system ha a storag devic , a rel shape analysi modul , a featur point locat search modul and an absolut shape analysi modul . the storag devic store first and second learn data which repres illumin base and 3d shape of object , respect . the rel shape analysi modul calcul an `` illumin basi '' of an object base on a 2d imag of the object and the first learn data , calcul a `` rel shape function '' that is partial differenti of a `` shape function '' indic a 3d shape of the object from the illumin basi , and output a rel shape data indic the rel shape function . the featur point locat search modul extract a plural of featur point from the input 2d face imag base on the 2d imag and the rel shape data , and output a featur point locat data indic locat of the featur point . the absolut shape analysi modul receiv the rel shape data and the featur point locat data , convert the rel shape function into the shape function by refer to the second learn data and the locat of the featur point , and output a 3d absolut shape data indic the shape function .
