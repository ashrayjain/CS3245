process for separ metal from semiconduct single-wal carbon nanotub a method for separ semiconduct single-wal carbon nanotub from metal single-wal carbon nanotub is disclos . the method util separ agent that preferenti associ with semiconduct nanotub due to the electr natur of the nanotub . the separ agent are those that have a planar orient , .pi.-electron avail for associ with the surfac of the nanotub , and also includ a solubl portion of the molecul . follow preferenti associ of the separ agent with the semiconduct nanotub , the agent/nanotub complex is solubl and can be solubil with the solut enrich in semiconduct nanotub while the residu solid is enrich in metal nanotub .
