biomed imag and analysi a method for synthes three dimension multimod imag set into a singl composit imag with accur registr and congruenc . surfac are initi extract from two or more differ imag to be match use semi-automat segment techniqu . these surfac are repres as contour with common featur to be match . a distanc transform is perform for one surfac imag , and a cost function for the match process is develop use the distanc imag . the geometr transform includ three-dimension translat , rotat and scale to accommod imag of differ posit , orient and size . the match process involv effici search thi multi-paramet space and adjust a surfac or surfac to find the best fit among them which minim the cost function . the local minima problem is address by use a larg number of start point . a pyramid multi-resolut approach is employ to speed up both the distanc transform comput and the multi-paramet minim process . robust in nois handl is accomplish use multipl threshold embed in the multi-resolut search . the method can regist both partial overlap and fragment surfac .
