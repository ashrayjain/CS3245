actinid extract method method of separ actinid from lanthanid are disclos . a regio-specific/stereo-specif dithiophosphin acid have organ moieti is provid in an organ solvent that is then contact with an acid medium contain an actinid and a lanthanid . the method can extend to separ actinid from one anoth . actinid are extract as a complex with the dithiophosphin acid . separ composit includ an aqueou phase , an organ phase , dithiophosphin acid , and at least one actinid . the composit may includ addit actinid and/or lanthanid . a method of produc a dithiophosphin acid compris at least two organ moieti select from aromat and alkyl , each moieti have at least one function group is also disclos . a sourc of sulfur is react with a halophosphin . an ammonium salt of the dithiophosphin acid product is precipit out of the reaction mixtur . the precipit salt is dissolv in ether . the ether is remov to yield the dithiophosphin acid .
