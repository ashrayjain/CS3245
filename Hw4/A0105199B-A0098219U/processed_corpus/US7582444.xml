use of floccul agent for separ the solid residu in hydrolys ferment substrat process for improv the separ effici of residu solid matter from the liquid phase of an aqueou acid hydrolys of a natur occur polysaccharid compris dissolv sugar , and residu acid wherein a floccul agent ( s ) is ad to the aqueou mixtur in an effect amount , and a process of produc ferment product compris the step of , ( i ) hydrolys a particul polysaccharid base plant deriv materi in an acid medium , and therebi form an aqueou mixtur compris dissolv sugar and solid matter , ( ii ) subject the aqueou mixtur to one or more separ stage in which solid matter are remov from the aqueou phase , ( iii ) adjust the ph of the obtain aqueou phase to a ph of at least 4 , ( iv ) ferment the dissolv sugar of the aqueou phase by a microorgan to produc a ferment product , ( v ) isol the ferment product , wherein in at least one separ stage in step ( ii ) a floccul agent is ad to the aqueou mixtur in an effect amount .
