steam-gener and gas-compressor system use water-bas evapor coolant , sealant and lubric a gas/air compressor system use for compress a gas/air stream of air , oxygen , oxygen-enrich air and other combust gase and deliv a moderate-to-high temperatur , moderate-to-high pressur fluid to a pipelin connect to one or more inject well . fuel with cool water is inject downhol for combust in the compress gas/air stream to be use for in-situ-retort of oil shale , volatil coal bed , tar sand , heavi oil and other hydrocarbon or carbonac deposit . a prefer embodi of the compressor system includ a compressor hous with a male screw rotor have helic lobe receiv in helic groov in a femal screw rotor . the hous includ a gas/air inlet for receiv the gas/air stream therein and a seri of water/miner injector for inject a water/miner slurri into the rotat screw rotor . the water/miner slurri act as a sealant , a lubric and also a coolant for male and femal screw rotor dure the compress cycl . the slurri is non-combust and non-react to combustion-support gase . also , the hous includ a gas/air outlet for discharg the compress gas/air stream into the pipelin connect to the inject well use in the in-situ-retort process .
