imag resolut increas method and apparatu for the same an imag resolut increas method includ reduc an input imag , calcul a first featur vector have a featur quantiti of a first block of a reduc imag , extract a high-frequ compon imag from the input imag , store pair each have the first featur vector and a second block of the high-frequ compon imag that is locat at the same posit as the first block as a look-up tabl , enlarg the input imag , calcul a second featur vector have a featur quantiti of a third block of an object in the input imag , search the look-up tabl for the first featur vector similar to the second featur vector , and ad a fourth block of the look-up tabl which pair with the first featur vector and a fifth block of the tempor enlarg imag that is locat at the same posit as the third block .
