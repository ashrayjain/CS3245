fiber-opt probe and method of measur biolog materi a method for monitor fluid media , such as a dynam biolog system , in a biolog reactor contain develop cultur fluid media . the method includ the step of direct light into the fluid media by way of one or more optic fiber to produc an illumin fluid media and then measur the intens of light reflect from the illumin fluid media by way of one or more optic fiber , the optic fiber be partit from the fluid media by a transpar window have inner and outer surfac ; the fiber have end termin adjac to and confront the inner surfac of the window and extend in a direct away from the window , the correspond end of the fiber be radial and circumferenti space from one anoth , the correspond end of the fiber have converg and intersect longitudin project therefrom , the intersect longitudin project from the fiber be entir within the window . addit , a fiber-opt probe is discuss .
