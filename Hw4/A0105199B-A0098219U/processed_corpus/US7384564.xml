electrolyt cell and process for remov of bromid ion and disinfect of sourc water use silver cathod and/or dimension stabl anod ( dsa ) : a process for the reduct of disinfectant/disinfect byproduct in drink water electrolyt process combin disinfect with remov of bromid from raw water . current is appli to the electrod in an electrolyt cell with raw water that ha some salin as the electrolyt . the electrod consist of silver or dimension stabl anod ( dsa ) as cathod and dimension stabl anod ( dsa ) arrang in parallel baffl fashion . dure electrolysi chlorid is convert to chlorin . the chlorin immedi effect disinfect of the water and reduct of bromid ion to bromin ga which is liber from the cell . aqueou bromin will remain in solut as hypobrom acid . the extent of chlorin gener and bromid loss depend upon the chlorid : bromid ratio , electr energi suppli for electrolysi , ionic strength of the water , electrod distanc , cell resid time and electrod materi .
