ice particl form and blast devic a solid surfac clean devic util a jet of ice particl of ultrapur water for remov contamin from a surfac of a solid such as a semiconductor wafer . the electr resist of ultrapur water store in a tank is reduc by mean of a ga such as dri air or carbon dioxid evolv into the water from a bubbl tube dispos in the tank . the water whose resist is thu reduc is spray from a nozzl into an ice-mak contain which is refriger by the vapor of a refriger discharg into the contain . the fine ice particl that are thu gener in the contain are spray and blast from a jet spray nozzl onto the surfac of the clean solid support within a jet spray chamber . the air insid the chamber is exhaust by a blower togeth with the ice particl that have been eject from the jet spray nozzl .
