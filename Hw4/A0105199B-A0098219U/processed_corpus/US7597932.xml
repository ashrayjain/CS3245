mesopor permeat layer for use on activ electron matrix devic the present invent provid improv synthet polym hydrogel permeat layer for use on activ electron matrix devic for biolog assay . the present invent includ method for form a permeat layer on an array of microelectrod includ the step of attach a linker to the surfac of the array and provid a polymer solut that includ a porogen . the surfac of the array is then contact with the polymer solut and the polymer solut is then polymer on the surfac of the array to form a permeat layer that is attach o the surfac of the array through the linker . the porogen is then remov from the permeat layer , therebi creat void space in the permeat layer .
