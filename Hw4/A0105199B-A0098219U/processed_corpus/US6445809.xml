environ monitor system in an environ monitor system use an optic flow , an optical-flow detect devic detect the optic flow in the step of reverse-project convert the earli imag of two earli and later imag pick up by an imag pick up , on the basi of a predetermin optic arrang of the imag pick-up mean onto an x-z plane in parallel to a road surfac in a real space to acquir a road surfac imag ; comput a move distanc of one 's own vehicl in two time on the basi of a time interv between two time and speed inform of one 's own vehicl ; parallel-shift the road surfac imag by the move distanc thu comput ; projection-convert the road surfac imag after parallel-shift to acquir an estim imag of the later imag in time ; acquir a differenti imag between the later imag and it estim imag to extract a featur point ; and search a correspond point of the featur point extract . in thi configur , it is possibl to prevent an object such as a paint which should not be detect on a road surfac from be erron detect as anoth surround vehicl .
