process for the aerobic-thermophil stabil and disinfect of sludg disclos is a method for the aerobic-thermophil stabil and decontamin of sludg , in which a ) raw sludg have a dri substanc concentr of 3 to 7 percent by weight is fed to a first stage and remain there for an averag dwell time of four to ten day at minimum temperatur of 42.degre . c. while an oxygen-contain ga is ad so as to obtain partial stabil sludg , b ) said partial stabil sludg is fed to a second stage in which the same is further stabil and decontamin for an averag dwell time that amount to 30 to 70 percent of the averag dwell time of the first stage at temperatur exceed 500.degre . c. while ad an oxygen-contain ga .
