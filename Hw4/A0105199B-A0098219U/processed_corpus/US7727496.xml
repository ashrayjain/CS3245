solvent extract of impur metal from a valuabl metal sulphat solut the present invent relat gener to a method of extract cobalt and other impur metal from a concentr nickel sulphat solut by a solvent extract process wherebi a cation solvent extract is separ pre-equilibr with a portion of a purifi nickel sulphat solut in such a manner that it is load with nickel without precipit insolubl nickel doubl salt . the nickel load extract is then transfer to an impur cobalt nickel solut where the cobalt and certain other impur metal exchang with nickel leav a purifi concentr nickel sulphat solut suitabl for hydrogen reduct or electrowin . the cobalt load extract is strip with dilut sulphur acid befor be recycl while an aqueou cobalt strip solut is further process to recov cobalt .
