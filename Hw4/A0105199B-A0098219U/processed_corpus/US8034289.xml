fluid treatment process and apparatu a water treatment process wherebi heat is use and recaptur to pasteur water and or sewag effluent . contamin water are partial treatabl util bacteri and chemic process ; howev some bacteria ( e.g . cryptosporidium and giardia ) are resist to chemic . the present process rais the temperatur of the water to a desir pasteur temperatur and for a correspond requir length of time to destroy pathogen and virus . a heat exchang is employ to use the wast heat from the pasteur tank to pre-heat the fluid enter the tank . after the initi heat of the tank , the pre-heat reduc the requir heat to maintain the temperatur of the tank . make-up heat increas the temperatur within a small temperatur rang . the make-up heat may be wast heat from a separ process .
