product of ferment product a process of produc ferment product compris the step of , ( i ) form an acidifi suspens of particul plant deriv materi compris a first polysaccharid which is more readili hydrolys and a second polysaccharid which is more difficult to hydrolys , ( ii ) allow the first polysaccharid to undergo hydrolysi by action of the acid at a temperatur of at least 50.degre . c. under condit such that the first polysaccharid is hydrolys and therebi form a mixtur of an aqueou liquor contain dissolv sugar and a solid residu contain the second polysaccharid , ( iii ) subject the mixtur to one or more separ stage in which the solid residu and aqueou sugar liquor are substanti separ from each other , ( iv ) option wash the residu substanti free of acid and sugar , ( v ) adjust the ph of the aqueou liquor to at least 4 , ( vi ) pass the aqueou liquor from step ( iv ) into a ferment stage where the dissolv sugar arc act upon by a microorgan in a ferment broth to produc a ferment product , ( vii ) contact the second polysaccharid by an enzym , said enzym hydrolys the second polysaccharid to the compon sugar , and allow the compon sugar to be act upon by a microorgan in the ferment broth to produc the ferment product , ( viii ) separ the ferment product from the broth , characteris in that the separ stage ( s ) in step ( iii ) is/ar assist by floccul of the solid by-product , employ one or more floccul agent ( s ) select from the group consist of water solubl polym , water swellabl polym and charg microparticul materi . typic such ferment product includ for instanc ethanol , glycerol , aceton , n-butanol , butanediol , isopropanol , butyr acid , methan , citric acid , fumar acid , lactic acid , propion acid , succin acid , itacon acid , acet acid , acetaldehyd , 3-hydroxypropion acid , glycon acid , tartar acid and amino acid such as l-glutar acid , l-lysin , l-aspart acid , l-tryptophan , l-arylglycin or salt of ani of these acid .
