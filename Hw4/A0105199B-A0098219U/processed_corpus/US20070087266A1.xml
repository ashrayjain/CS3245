modular batteri system disclos herein is a modular batteri system have at least one set of batteri modul , prefer monoblock modul connect in seri . each of the batteri modul may be design with a first endplat and a second endplat , wherein each batteri modul is set between the first and second endplat and at least one band member coupl the endplat to each other , bind the batteri modul between the endplat . the endplat are secur between a pair of rail and the system is dispos in a system hous . a cool manifold provid a system wherein coolant flow into and out of each batteri modul . the system hous prefer ha a coolant inlet and a coolant outlet . the cool manifold is in flow commun with the coolant inlet and the coolant outlet . a batteri monitor system , which may includ a batteri control modul and at least one remot sens modul , prefer monitor and collect perform and statu inform , such as voltag and temperatur , of the batteri modul . an integr control unit ( icu ) may be dispos in the system hous . the icu support electron , some of which are use to collect electr energi produc by the batteri modul and/or monitor the system .
