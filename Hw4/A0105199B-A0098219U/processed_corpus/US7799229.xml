process for the remov of catalyt metal and promot metal from carbonyl process stream process for the select remov of iridium carbonyl catalyst metal and/or at least one promot select from ruthenium , osmium and rhenium from a liquid composit compris a carbonyl product , iridium carbonyl catalyst metal and/or the promot metal , corros metal and option alkali or alkalin earth metal . the process is carri out by contact the liquid composit with a chelat resin to remov at least a portion of the iridium carbonyl catalyst metal and/or at least one promot metal contain in the liquid composit . the chelat resin contain at least one thiourea function group . the process is suitabl for treat process stream obtain in the product of carboxyl acid and/or carboxyl anhydrid .
