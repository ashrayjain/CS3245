organ wast treatment use anaerob and facult anaerob bacteria a method to prepar an organ composit for a digestor minim injuri to and enhanc the decomposit function of anaerob and facult anaerob bacteria in the organ composit . the method is util at an anim process facil . manur produc at the facil is period collect at least seven day interv and at a temperatur greater than thirty-two degre f. larg piec of inorgan materi are remov from the manur while preserv a signific proport of the live anaerob and facult anaerob bacteria in the manur . the decomposit activ of anaerob and facult anaerob bacteria is facilit by , at a temperatur in the rang of fifti degre f to one hundr and five degre f , ad water to produc a slurri includ seventy-f to ninety-f percent by weight water and twenty-f to five percent by weight of organ materi . organ materi in the slurri is separ into particl have a length in the rang of one micron to one-eighth of an inch . inorgan materi is remov from the slurri at a temperatur in the rang of fifti degre f to nineti degre f and while preserv the live anaerob and facult bacteria in the slurri to produc a slurri product compris of less than twenty-f percent by weight of said organ materi . the slurri product is transport to a digestor . the anaerob and facult anaerob bacteria in the slurri product to decompos in the digestor organ materi in the slurri product .
