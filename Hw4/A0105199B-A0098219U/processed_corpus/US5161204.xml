apparatu for gener a featur matrix base on normal out-class and in-class variat matric a method and apparatu under softwar control for pattern recognit util a neural network implement to recogn two dimension input imag which are suffici similar to a databas of previous store two dimension imag . imag are first imag process and subject to a fourier transform which yield a power spectrum . an in-class to out-of-class studi is perform on a typic collect of imag in order to determin the most discriminatori region of the fourier transform . a featur vector consist of the highest order ( most discriminatori ) magnitud inform from the power spectrum of the fourier transform of the imag is form . featur vector are input to a neural network have prefer two hidden layer , input dimension of the number of element in the featur vector and output dimension of the number of data element store in the databas . uniqu identifi number are prefer store along with the featur vector . applic of a queri featur vector to the neural network will result in an output vector . the output vector is subject to statist analysi to determin if a suffici high confid level exist to indic that a success identif ha been made . where a success identif ha occur , the uniqu identifi number may be display .
