bio tank/ga replenish system in system for treat wastewat liquid by util aerob biolog speci , the contamin wastewat stream is pretreat in a dissolv air flotat system to remov suspend solid wast , includ larg particl such as fat , greas , and physic emulsifi oil . the purifi wastewat contain dissolv wast is thereaft gasifi and further decontamin in a bioreactor tank . biolog speci in the bioreactor tank consum ga and perform bodili function that convert dissolv wast into easili remov carbon dioxid and suspend solid . ga consum by the biolog speci is replenish by pump the wastewat though a liquid-ga mixer . a control regul the speed of the pump base on real-tim ga concentr measur provid by a correspond ga probe dispos within the wastewat in the bioreactor tank .
