high throughput magnet isol techniqu and devic for biolog materi the present applic disclos a process for the high throughput separ of at least one distinct biolog materi from a sampl use magnet tag and a magnet separ set up capabl of process at least about 10.sup.6 units/second . a magnet field gradient is use to deflect target materi bear a magnet tag from one laminar flow stream to anoth so that the magnet tag target materi exit a separ chamber via a differ outlet than the rest of the sampl . the process is applic to isol sever distinct biolog materi by direct each via magnet deflect to it own uniqu outlet . the applic also disclos a system for perform the process and a kit that includ the system and the magnet tag .
