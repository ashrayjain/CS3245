gener method and gener for gener mist or fine-bubbl by use surfac acoust wave in a gener method and a gener of mist or fine-bubbl , with a simpl and small configur , applic into a wide rang kind of liquid is enabl , and gener stabli the mist or the fine-bubbl or both is enabl . the gener is provid with a piezoelectr substrat which equip two or more comb-lik electrod on a surfac and arrang so that the surfac may intersect the mutual interfac of the ga and the liquid and a part of piezoelectr substrat is put in a liquid , and a surfac acoust wave excit on the surfac with the electrod is made to propag along the surfac so that may exist in the upper and lower side of an interfac . the surfac acoust wave gener mist in the ga side which is abov the interfac , and gener fine-bubbl in the liquid side which is below the interfac . sinc the mist and the fine-bubbl are gener with the surfac acoust wave , without be base on mechan oper for gener a turn stream , the mist and the fine-bubbl can be stabli gener in the simpl and small configur .
