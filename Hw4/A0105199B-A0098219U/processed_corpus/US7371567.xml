bioreactor , particularli for bioartifici organ a bioreactor for bioartifici organ , compris a close and substanti tubular bodi insid which there is a contain caviti ; an anim and/or human cell cultur and support structur , accommod in the caviti and suitabl to be cross by a fluid to be process ; a port for the inflow of the fluid to be process , which is form in the bodi upstream of the structur ; a port for the outflow of the process fluid , which is form in the bodi downstream of the structur ; a first chamber for collect the fluid to be process , which is form in the caviti upstream of the structur and is connect to the outsid of the bodi by mean of the inflow port ; a second chamber for collect the process fluid , which is form in the caviti downstream of the structur and is connect to the outsid of the bodi by mean of the outflow port ; a first bundl of hollow capillari fiber for the inflow of the fluid to be process , which is accommod in the caviti and is interpos between the first collect chamber and the structur , and a second bundl of hollow capillari fiber for the outflow of the process fluid , which is accommod in the caviti and is interpos between the structur and the second collect chamber , the flow of the fluid be substanti parallel to the longitudin axi of the bioreactor .
