ga sparg the invent relat to a method for oper interact differ unit , particularli of an instal , with differ control that control these advanc control sequenc , particularli with differ control puls . the invent method is character in that the clock puls ( ipo.sub.i ) of the differ control ( 3.1 , 3.2 , 3.3 ) are interpol to a common system clock puls ( t.sub.tiex ) , and that the control sequenc are synchron . a devic suit for carri out the invent method correspondingli compris at least one common interpol devic ( 5.3 ) for the control ( 3.1 , 3.2. , 3.3 ) for interpol the clock puls ( ipo.sub.i ) of the differ control ( 3.1 , 3.2 , 3.3 ) to a common system clock puls ( t.sub.tiex ) and at least one synchron devic ( 5 ) for synchron the control sequenc .
