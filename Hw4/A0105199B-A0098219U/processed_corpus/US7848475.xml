low head loss modular suction strainer with contour surfac a strainer for an emerg core cool system ( ecc ) in a nuclear power plant compris a perfor strainer element that is immers in a reservoir of cool water , which is drawn through the strainer element into the emerg core cool system . the side of the strainer element in contact with the cool water ha a contour configur for disrupt the format of a flat bed of fibrou materi that can trap small particul materi intend to pass through the strainer element . incorpor thi strainer element into an ecc strainer enabl the strainer to be made more compact , becaus the debri bed need not be spread over an unduli larg area to prevent excess head loss from the debri load in the event of a reactor loss of coolant accid . the strainer also incorpor a modular construct that use individu strainer disc modul . each disc modul includ a perfor first disc part have a central open and a perfor second disc part also have a central open . the first and second disc part fit togeth to form an interior space with face perfor major surfac and an axial open , and connect tube between the disc place the axial open in fluid commun . the entir assembl is secur togeth by tie rod that hold the disc togeth with the connect tube compress between them .
