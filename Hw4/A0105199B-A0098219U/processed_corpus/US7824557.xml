method for control microbi biofilm in aqueou system a process ha been found which increas the effici and effect of introduc antimicrobi compound into complex biofilm matric through the use of liposom carrier , therebi remov the biofoul in industri water bear system , includ pipe , heat exchang , condens , filtrat system and fluid storag tanks.accord to one embodi of the invent , antimicrobi compound contain liposom are ad to water system prone to biofoul and biofilm format . the liposom , be similar in composit to microbi membran or cell , are readili incorpor into the exist biofilm . onc the antimicrobi compound contain liposom becom entrain with the biofilm matrix , the decomposit or program disintegr of the liposom proce . thereaft the biocid aqueou core is releas to react directli with the biofilm encas microorgan . upon the death of the organ , the polysaccharide/protein matrix decompos and therebi result in reduc foul of the water bear system , result in increas heat transfer , increas flux , less deposit of colloid and particul solid and dissolv organ on the surfac of the microfiltr membran , therebi reduc the frequenc and durat of the membran clean and ultim replac .
