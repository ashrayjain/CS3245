solid hollow fiber cool crystal system and method a solid hollow fiber cool crystal and method for crystal aqueou and organ solut are provid . the solid hollow fiber crystal ( shfc ) for carri out cool crystal of inorganic/organ microsolutes/macrosolut from solut gener includ a bundl of non-por hollow fiber mount within a shell where a feed solut for crystal flow through the lumen side of the hollow fiber and a cool solut flow through the shell side to form nuclei and subsequ crystal in the feed solut at a temperatur below it satur temperatur . the solid hollow fiber crystal may be combin with a mix devic , such as a complet stir tank or static mixer , to further effectu crystal . the solid hollow fiber crystal may be oper in a number of mode includ feed recycl mode , onc through mode , shfc-in-lin static mixer in seri mode , and shfc-cst in seri mode . the advantag of solid hollow fiber cool crystal in comparison to convent crystal process includ improv temperatur control between crystal solut and coolant , higher nucleat rate , improv control of crystal size and crystal size distribut , smaller crystal size , capabl for decoupl crystal nucleat and crystal growth , decreas foul of process equip , and improv process scale-up .
