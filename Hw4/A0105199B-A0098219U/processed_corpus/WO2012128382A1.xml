devic and method for lip motion detect a devic for video-bas lip motion detect is provid , which compris : a face search unit adapt for search a face in an input video frame ; a mouth region extract unit adapt for extract a mouth region from the search face ; a visual featur extract unit adapt for extract at least one of a gradient on spatial-tempor plane and a local binari pattern ( lbp ) code on spatial-tempor plane for each pixel in a spatial-tempor window and extract a visual featur of the mouth region base on the extract result ; and a detect unit adapt for detect lip motion base on the extract visual featur of the mouth region . a method for video-bas lip motion detect is also provid . accord to the present invent , the detect accuraci can be improv without re-train or adapt for a particular user .
