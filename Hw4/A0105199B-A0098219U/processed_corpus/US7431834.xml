wast water and sludg treatment apparatu in a system for separ crystal from sludg , or from separ water gener when sludg is subject to a concentr process or a dewat process , aspect of both phosphoru remov and phosphoru recoveri can be satisfi , map have a high degre of puriti can be recov , and stabl treatment can be perform such that the map recoveri rate is high and blockag of a hydrocyclon do not occur . an aspect of the present invent is a crystal separ apparatu for separ crystal from sludg , or from separ water gener when sludg is subject to a concentr process or a dewat process , compris a hydrocyclon for separ the crystal from the sludg or separ water introduc into the hydrocyclon , and a return pipe a for return the sludg or separ water which flow out from an overflow riser of the hydrocyclon to a sludg or separ water introduct portion of the hydrocyclon .
