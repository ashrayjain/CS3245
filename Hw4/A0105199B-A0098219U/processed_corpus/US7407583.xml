in-situ groundwat nitrif and de-nitrif remedi system a method of in-situ groundwat nitrif , by : extract groundwat from the ground ; ad oxygen to the extract groundwat ; ad nutrient to the extract groundwat ; and inject the groundwat back into the ground , wherein the oxygen react with in-situ nitrifi bacteria to oxid ammonia to nitrat , and wherein the nutrient encourag the nitrifi bacteria to grow and reproduc . a method of in-situ groundwat de-nitrif , by : extract the groundwat from the ground ; ad carbon to the extract groundwat ; ad nutrient to the extract groundwat ; and inject the groundwat back into the ground , wherein the carbon react with in-situ de-nitrifi bacteria to reduc nitrat to nitrogen ga , and wherein the nutrient encourag the de-nitrifi bacteria to grow and reproduc .
