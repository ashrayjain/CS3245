imag search apparatu and imag search method an imag search apparatu ha : a dimens reduc unit for reduc dimens of multidimension featur data to be produc as approxim data ; an approximate-data store unit for store the produc approxim data with correspond to the multidimension featur data befor the dimens reduct ; a search request receiv unit for receiv an identifi which identifi multidimension featur data of a person to be search , at least as a search key ; an approximate-spac search unit for calcul distanc between approxim data correspond to the receiv search key , and plural approxim data store in the approximate-data store unit , and for arrang the distanc in order of similar ; and a real-spac final rank unit for again perform a distanc calcul with use the multidimension featur data befor the dimens reduct , on a group of result in which the similar is high , and for determin final rank .
