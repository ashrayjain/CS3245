substrat clean method a method is provid for reduc the amount of film fragment discharg into a process liquid circul system dure remov of film from wafer , therebi reduc the frequenc of filter clean or filter replac . the method includ expos a wafer contain a film form thereon in a process chamber of a substrat process system to a process liquid , where the wafer is not rotat or is rotat at a first speed and the process liquid is discharg from the process chamber to a process liquid circul system . subsequ , exposur of the wafer to the process liquid is discontinu and the wafer is rotat at a second speed greater than the first speed to centrifug remov fragment of the film from the wafer . next , the wafer is expos to the same or a differ process liquid and the process liquid is discharg from the process chamber to a process liquid drain .
