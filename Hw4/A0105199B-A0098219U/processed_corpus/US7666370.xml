sodium salt recycl process for use in wet reprocess process of spent nuclear fuel the present disclosur relat to a process for recycl a sodium salt by decomposit of a sodium nitrid liquid wast , compris a neutral step in which a nitric acid liquid wast or an off-ga have nitric acid dissolv therein which is produc through a wet reprocess process compris a dissolut step for dissolv a spent nuclear fuel in nitric acid is neutral by ad or contact the nitrat liquid wast or the off-ga to or with at least one sodium salt select from the group consist of sodium hydroxid , sodium hydrogencarbon and sodium carbon , therebi yield a sodium nitrat liquid wast ; a sodium nitrate-decomposit step in which the sodium nitrat liquid wast is reduct decompos with a reduc agent , therebi decompos sodium nitrat into a nitrogen ga and the sodium salt ; and a recycl step for recycl the sodium salt into the neutral step or wet reprocess process .
