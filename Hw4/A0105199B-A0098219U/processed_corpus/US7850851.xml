biolog phosphoru remov a process for treat wast water to remov phosphor and nitrogen in a treatment system includ an anaerob zone ( 5 ) contain an anaerob mix liquor have organ which releas phosphor into the anaerob mix liquor ; an anox zone ( 7 ) contain an anox mix liquor have organ which uptak phosphor and denitrifi the anox mix liquor and an aerob zone ( 9 ) contain an aerob mix liquor have organ which uptak phosphor and nitrifi the aerob mix liquor ; the process includ the step of provid wastewat to be treat into the anaerob zone ( 5 ) and commun anaerob mix liquor from the anaerob zone ( 5 ) to the anox zone ( 7 ) . the anox mix liquor is then commun from the anox zone ( 7 ) to the anaerob zone ( 5 ) and the anox mix liquor from the anox zone ( 7 ) to the ambl zone ( 9 ) . the aerob mix liquor is appli to a feed side of a membran filter ( 10 ) to produc a treat effluent from a filtrat side of the membran filter ( 10 ) . oxygen-contain ga bubbl is flow past the feed side of the membran filter ( 10 ) to remov accumul solid . at least some of the materi reject by the membran filter ( 10 ) is commun to a degass devic ( 20 ) to remov some or all of ani dissolv oxygen contain in the reject materi and the degass materi is commun to the anox zone ( 7 ) .
