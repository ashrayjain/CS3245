system and method for wastewat odor control a synergist composit is provid for control odor from wast product . the composit compris a combin of nitrat salt , sulfide-consum compound , ph-elev compound , sulfide-oxid , nitrate-reduc bacteria , and sulfide-oxid enzym . the method includ ad a suffici amount of the composit to a wast stream to provid suffici sulfide-consum compound to effect immedi remov of sulfid . the composit incorpor a ph elev compound , which both decreas the amount of gaseou h.sub.2 and put the aqueou phase into a ph rang where natur occur bacteria can more easili metabol the sulfid . the composit also includ one or more nitrat salt which will accomplish longer term prevent of odor . specif bacteria are incorpor into the formul to insur that the nitrat ha the right type and amount of bacteria present to prevent format of and/or consum sulfid . specif enzym are incorpor into the formul to promot oxid of sulfid .
