method for electromagnet treatment of water confer a biolog activ thereon the water is at the origin of an entir seri of geolog and climat process and is primarili the basi of all form of life . actual , it is the major compon of all live organ ( 50 % to 98 % ) ; the human bodi contain 70 % of the total mass thereof . the biospher in it entireti consist of 80 % water . although thi may be one of the most highli examin liquid , it properti compris numer anomali have not yet all been elucid . it play an essenti role in the structur and metabol of all live be . thi biolog role is due to it physic and chemic properti that are out of the ordinari . bernal and flower establish a rule defin that each oxygen atom ha two hydrogen atom as neighbor and each hydrogen bond contain one hydrogen atom . the separ of the liquid water molecul produc the format of hydroxyl ion ( oh.sup.- ) and hydronium ion ( h.sub.3o.sup.+ ) , which hamper thi rule . the appear of oh.sup.- and h.sub.3o.sup.+ ion produc `` ionic defect '' in the structur of the water ( bernal , j. and fowler , r. ( 1933 ) . `` a theori of water and ionic solut , with particular refer to hydrogen and hydroxyl ion . '' journal of chemic physic 1 ( 8 ) : 515-548 ) . in the absenc of an electr field , there is an equilibrium between the hydroxyl ion and the hydronium ion . if an electromagnet field that polar in water is sent on , these two ion move independ and the equilibrium is broken . these ionic compound can go to be adsorb , for exampl , on colloid particl .
