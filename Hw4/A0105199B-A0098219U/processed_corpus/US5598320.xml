rotabl and slidebl heat pipe apparatu for reduc heat build up in electron devic a rotat and slidabl heat pipe apparatu for transfer heat away from a microprocessor chip more rapidli than by heat sink surfac area dissip to the surround air alon , compris a heat sink with an integr cylindr passageway adapt to receiv a first end of a heat pipe shape like a crankshaft , and a heat spreader form from a metal plate with a first end roll up to defin a cylindr open adapt to receiv a second end of the heat pipe . the heat spreader is attach to an undersid of a keyboard . sinc the heat pipe is abl to rotat within the cylindr passageway and the cylindr open , the keyboard can be rais to an open posit and lower to a close posit quickli and simpli without the risk of break or bend the heat pipe , and manufactur posit toler between the heat pipe apparatu compon are increas result in a simplifi manufactur process . the heat pipe can also be slid in to and out of the cylindr passageway or the cylindr open , therebi enabl comput manufactur to incorpor the heat pipe into portabl batteri power notebook-typ comput system design to allow a user to remov , replac , or swap intern compon by simpli flip open or remov the keyboard , and further enabl a user to perform mainten work or repair on the comput system without concern for damag to the heat pipe .
