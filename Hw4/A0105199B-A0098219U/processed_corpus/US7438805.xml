apparatu for reduc volum of sludg the ph valu of excess sludg taken out from a biolog oxid tank ( 2 ) is adjust to 8 to 14 , and the ph-adjust sludg is inject into a solubil devic ( 3 ) . the sludg taken out from the solubil devic ( 3 ) is heat to 110.degre . c. to 350.degre . c. at a pressur higher than satur steam pressur to solubil the sludg to a state readili degrad by microorgan . the solubil sludg is return to a biolog oxid tank ( 2 ) , and the ph valu of the sludg in the biolog oxid tank ( 2 ) to 5 to 9 . the use of the abov method of treat excess sludg and an apparatu therefor enabl substanti reduc the volum of excess sludg with econom advantag .
