method and plant for desalin salt-contain water salt-contain water is desalin by first pass salt-contain water through a heat exchang dispos in a basin contain solar-h brine form by sever layer of water lie one abov the other in the basin , each of the layer of water form the brine have a higher salt content than the layer present there abov . the heat exchang is in the lowermost layer of water have a higher temperatur than the temperatur of the layer of water lie abov the lowermost layer of water . the salt-contain water is heat in the basin by solar energi indirect heat exchang with the solar-h brine to obtain heat salt-contain water . at least part of the heat salt-contain water is evapor to obtain water vapor , and the water vapor is condens to obtain desalin water .
