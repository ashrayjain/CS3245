method for the product of natur energi from wast the method aim at obtain from wast and more particularli from municip solid wast ( msw ) the energi contain therein at the highest level for industri use by mean of natur technolog and with low environment impact . the method , denot by the acronym new ( natur energi from wast ) oper through the follow process phase : a ) aerob digest of the putresc biolog part to produc stabil wast which is easi to handl , b ) separ of a fraction rich in materi with a high heat valu , c ) storag of the residu , rich in biodegrad and inert substanc , compact into appropri geometr shape in bioreactor which can be activ and seal , d ) activ of the bioreactor with water and their servic in time dure anaerob digest to suppli bioga to be use for the product of energi , e ) bio-stabil and dehydr of the residu materi of the anaerob treatment with air , f ) possibl recoveri of the materi produc in thi way . in thi way the energi contain in the wast , is extract at the most refin level in the form of plastic , plastic/pap and methan for energi use with maximum yield and reduc product of ash , and the end materi leav the bioreactor is fulli exhaust of it energi content and inertis .
