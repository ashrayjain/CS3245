oxid tank control valv assembl and system and method for replenish a charg of oxygen-contain ga within an oxid tank contamin are remov from fluid in a system where the fluid is spray into an air head at the top of a tank through a diffus and withdrawn through a pick-up tube . a solenoid valv oper to allow oxygen-contain ga from a compress ga sourc to flow into the tank through a shuttl valv , which is open by the ga pressur . simultan , a drain valv connect to the shuttl valv open a drain , vent water and air from the tank . the solenoid valv also oper to close the ga suppli line and connect the shuttl valv through a vent to atmospher . pressur within the tank close the shuttl valv , which in turn close the drain valv and disconnect the shuttl valv from the tank . a one-way-flow valv prevent fluid or ga from flow from the tank backward through the shuttl valv to the solenoid valv and out the vent .
