desalin system the invent provid method and an apparatu for more effici and econom produc purifi water from sea water or some other salti or brackish water sourc . the effici is deriv from the co-loc with a power plant or other thermal gener sourc that will heat the feed water . revers osmosi membran filtrat system work optim when the feed water is at certain higher temperatur , where that temperatur is typic higher than the feed water at ambient temperatur . by use the heat sea water as the byproduct of the power plant electr gener process and if necessari mix it with ambient temperatur sea water , if need to lower the water temperatur , and use thi feed water with a higher temperatur than ambient water temperatur , the effici of the revers osmosi system can be increas .
