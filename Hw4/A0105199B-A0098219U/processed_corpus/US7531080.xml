mediat electrochem oxid use for sterilization/disinfect a medic electrochem oxid process is use for sterilization/disinfect of contamin instrument and infecti wast . contamin instrument and wast are introduc into an apparatu for contact the infecti wast with an electrolyt contain the oxid form of one or more revers redox coupl , at least one of which is produc at the anod of an electrochem cell . the oxid speci of the redox coupl oxid the infecti wast molecul and are themselv convert to their reduc form , whereupon they are reoxid by either of the aforement mechan and the redox cycl continu until all oxidiz infecti wast speci have undergon the desir degre of oxid . the entir process take place at temperatur between ambient and approxim 100 degre celsiu . the oxid process will be enhanc by the addit of reaction of reaction enhanc , such as : ultrason energi and/or ultraviolet radiat .
