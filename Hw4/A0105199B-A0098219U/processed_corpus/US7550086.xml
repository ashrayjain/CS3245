advanc treatment method of ethanolamine-wastewat base on physico-chem and biolog coupl process advanc treatment method and system of ethanolamine-contain wastewat are disclos , which perform physicochem and biolog treatment process . the method regener cation exchang resin that captur ethanolamin discharg from a nuclear power plant or a thermal power station , concentr the ethanolamine-contain wastewat to reduc the volum of the wastewat , and then treat the highli concentr ethanolamine-contain wastewat through biolog decomposit and denitrif process . the system for treat ethanolamine-contain wastewat perform the physicochem process ( ion-exchang and resin regener ) where the waster is concentr , and then appli the biolog process to the small amount of wastewat highli concentr . the physicochem process is compos of exchang ion and eluting/concentr ethanolamin use sodium hydroxid . the wastewat of a few to ten of thousand ppm is transfer and undergo a biolog process where the ethanolamin is decompos , convert into co.sub.2 and n.sub.2 through the anox tank and two aerob tank , and then discharg in ga . therefor , the wastewat is discharg , satisfi the biochem oxygen demand valu and the nitrogen content requir by the environment discharg standard .
