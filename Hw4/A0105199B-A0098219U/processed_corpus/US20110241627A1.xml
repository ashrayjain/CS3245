batteri charger for portabl electron equip there is offer a batteri charger for a portabl electron devic that ha a simpl structur and is capabl of detect that the portabl electron devic is connect to the batteri charger . a first power suppli line is connect to a posit termin ( + ) of a recharg batteri , while a ground line is connect to a neg termin ( - ) of the recharg batteri . an output transistor is connect between the first power suppli line and a second power suppli line . the output transistor is connect to a vbu termin of a usb connector through the second power suppli line . a control output a voltag of an h level to the vbu termin to detect a chang in a voltag at the vbu termin , and judg whether the portabl electron devic is connect to the usb connector base on a result of the detect . the control turn the output transistor on when the portabl electron devic is judg to be connect to the usb connector .
