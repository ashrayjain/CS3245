method and apparatu for collect and acclimat anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria , and denitrifi water a method for collect bacteri cell includ feed water contain ammonium and nitrit to an anaerob ammonium oxid vessel to denitrifi ammonium and nitrit by anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria provid in the anaerob ammonium oxid vessel to form denitrifi water contain an amount of the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria and a sludg contain an amount of the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria ; and feed the denitrifi water contain an amount of the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria and the sludg contain an amount of the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria to a precipit vessel , in which an acclimat contain is store , to caus the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria in the denitrifi water to be attach to an immobil materi in the acclimat contain , so that the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria in the denitrifi water are collect , and , at the same time , to collect the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria of the sludg in a separ sludg by solid-liquid separ in the precipit vessel .
