nanobubbl util method and devic the present inventor have found the presenc of a nanobubbl that ha not been confirm convent , and establish a method for produc nanobubbl . the inventor have determin the theoret expect characterist of the produc nanobubbl , found new characterist by analyz data experiment collect , and elucid the relationship among the charact . specif , the inventor have found that a nanobubbl ha featur such as decreas of the buoyant forc , increas of the surfac area , increas of the surfac activ , gener of a local high-pressur field , interfac activ action , and steril action thank to electrostat polar . by the associ among the featur , ani of wide varieti of object can be clean with high perform and with light environment load thank to the function of adsorb foul compon , the function of clean the surfac of an object quickli , and the steril function , and pollut water can be purifi . nanobubbl can be appli to an organ to recov from fatigu and effect use for chemic reaction .
