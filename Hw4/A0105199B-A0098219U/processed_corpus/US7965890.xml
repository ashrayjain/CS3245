target recognit system and method a target recognit system and method . the invent method includ the step of first receiv an imag of a scene within which a target may be includ and second use constrain imag segment as a basi for target recognit . in the specif embodi , the segment is variabl and deriv from target geometri model . the constrain imag segment is adapt to use target geometri model to deriv altern imag segment hypothes . the hypothes are verifi use a novel hierarch adapt region model matcher . in the best mode , the hierarch adapt region model matcher is fulli hierarch and includ the step of receiv an imag and a hypothesi with respect to a target in the imag . in the illustr embodi , the hypothesi contain the type , locat , and/or orient of a hypothes target in the imag . the hypothesi is receiv by a model tree gener . a target model librari provid a plural of comput gener target model . the model tree gener retriev a model from the librari base on a hypothes target type and render a model tree therefrom that repres the appear of a hypothes target at a hypothes locat and orient . in the illustr embodi , the verif model further includ a search manag adapt to receiv a model tree from the model tree gener . a featur extractor is includ along with a segment evalu . the segment evalu is coupl to receiv imag featur from the featur extractor . the segment evalu is adapt to output a segment score to the search manag with respect to a specifi set of segment label base on a suppli set of imag featur for an activ node .
