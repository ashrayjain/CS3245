method and separ modul for the separ of particl from a dispers , in particular of blood corpuscl from blood a method for separ particl from a fluid dispers , particularli for separ corpuscular compon from biolog sampl , abov all from blood . a separ modul suitabl for perform the method ha a substrat with flow channel , compris a feed channel for suppli the dispers to a junction , a first drain channel for drain fluid have a reduc particl concentr away from the junction , and a second drain channel for drain fluid have an increas particl concentr away from the junction . the fluid flow so much faster in the second drain channel than in the first drain channel that due to the differ flow speed the dispers particl preferenti flow at the junction further in the second drain channel .
