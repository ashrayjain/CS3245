method of produc pure halid salt of alkalin and/or alkalin earth metal result from hydrolyt treatment of halogen organ wast materi pure halogen salt of alkalin and/or alkalin earth metal or a mixtur thereof are prepar by ( i ) hydrolyt heat a suspens of 1 part by weight of a halogen , organ wast materi in a comminut state in 1-10 part by weight of an aqueou medium in the presenc of a base to a temperatur rang from 200-300.degre . c. at a pressur suffici to maintain the water in a liquid state for a period of time suffici to convert substanti all the organ bound halogen present to inorgan halid , and ( ii ) separ the hydrolys obtain in step ( i ) into a solid hydrolys fraction and a liquid hydrolys fraction , ( iii ) neutral the liquid hydrolys with hydrohalogen acid , ( iv ) ad a floccul to the neutral hydrolys ; ( v ) separ the materi from step ( iv ) into a solid contain fraction and an aqueou solut ; and ( vi ) nanofilt the aqueou solut to obtain a retent and a permeat , wherein the permeat is further treat to obtain the pure salt .
