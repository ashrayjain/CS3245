method and devic for ultrason manipul particl within a fluid fluid-handl method and devic for ultrason manipul of fluid-born particl compris a fluid-handl manifold and an ultrason particl manipul defin an ultrason caviti within the manifold . fluid-born particl introduc into the manifold are manipul by control ultrason stand wave at the ultrason caviti . caviti have non-uniform configur , asymmetr stand wave and/or multipl ultrason caviti within the manifold are oper to control the movement of the fluid-born particl , option includ collect and hold such particl , transfer particl through an intersect from one channel to anoth , etc . solid phase extract ( spe ) particl , biolog particl and other fluid-born particl can be manipul within the fluid-handl manifold .
