anaerob reactor for the remov of long chain fatti acid from fat contain wastewat the invent present is an apparatu specif design for the high rate anaerob treatment of ( wast ) water with rel high concentr of lipid compound , refer to as the invert anaerob sludg blanket ( iasb ) reactor . contrari to convent anaerob reactor , it avoid the need of sludg with good settl properti and exploit the problem of sludg flotat due to long chain fatti acid ( lcfa ) or bioga adsorpt onto the sludg and/or bioga encapsul by the sludg . furthermor , it provid an increas specif sludg surfac area for better lcfa degrad . it is fed from the top and is equip with a separ step at the bottom . reactor content are thoroughli mix by the novel combin action of a ga lift loop and a liquid recycl over the reactor . the reactor can be oper in continu and sequenti mode . although it is specif design for lipid degrad , it applic is not limit to thi .
