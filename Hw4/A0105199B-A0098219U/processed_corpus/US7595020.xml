method of treat biolog and chemic agent with ga phase , electron excit state of oxygen an improv singlet oxygen gener ( sog ) and method of use ga phase electron excit state of oxygen for bio-med and chemic treatment applic are disclos . accord to the invent , both ga phase o.sub.2 ( .sup.1.sigma . ) and o.sub.2 ( .sup.1.delta . ) are use for medic treatment , steril , and deactiv of biolog and chemic agent , includ diseas tissu and biolog and chemic weapon . the improv sog is compact and scalabl , portabl , capabl of oper in a zero-grav or low graviti environ , may use gaseou diluent or buffer ga , and is capabl of oper at pressur as high as one atmospher . the sog is capabl of oper within a short distanc of the target site for the electron excit state of oxygen , which are deliv to the target site via a conduit . the sog and deliveri system provid higher yield of electron excit oxygen with longer lifetim suitabl for bio-med applic .
