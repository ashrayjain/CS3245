method and apparatu for treat mix wast by pyrolysi a method and apparatu for treat mix wast by pyrolysi . organ mass is carbon by heat to carbon in a pyrolysi reactor ( 3 ) in an oxygen-fre environ . pyrolysi gase are distil for oil and the gase are use for energi product . solid matter result from pyrolysi is siev for separ inorgan coars particl from a carbon fraction . the carbon fraction is mill in two oper , first with a roller mill ( 8 ) and then with a jet mill ( 10 ) , a remov of metal be perform between the oper . the pulver carbon fraction is classifi by mean of ioniz particl separ ( 11 , 12 , 13 ) . the multi-stag particl separ is follow by discharg clean air and recov fine carbon .
