method for nucleic acid isol and instrument for nucleic acid isol the present invent relat to a techniqu for effici isol of long nucleic acid and short nucleic acid from a sampl contain long nucleic acid and short nucleic acid via safe and conveni oper . specif , long nucleic acid and short nucleic acid are isol from a sampl contain nucleic acid by mix a chaotrop agent with the sampl contain nucleic acid , allow the mix solut to pass at least twice through a first solid phase contain silica that ha passag pore have predetermin pore size , allow the mix solut to pass at least twice through a second solid phase contain silica that ha passag pore have pore size smaller than those of the first solid phase contain silica , and separ recov nucleic acid that have bound to the first solid phase contain silica and those that have bound to the second solid phase contain silica .
