method and devic for cool of electronic/comput equip and use thereof the invent relat to a cool system for cool of electronic/comput equip in a station , where the equip is arrang in an equip room . the system includ a cool batteri ( 18 ) and a fan devic ( 19 ) , where the fan devic ( 19 ) caus a heat exchang air circul between batteri ( 18 ) and equip where the air , via air guid devic ( 38 ) , is guid from the batteri ( 18 ) to the equip . accord to the invent there is in the air guid devic ( 38 ) a first chamber ( 31 ) with an inlet ( 37 ) which commun with the batteri ( 18 ) , and a second chamber ( 32 ) with an outlet ( 39 ) which commun with the equip . the first and second chamber are separ by a low impuls devic ( 30 ) , prefer in form of a perfor partit wall equip with filter cloth . by that is effect that the turbul flow of the air which leav the fan ( 19 ) chang to laminar flow when it flow toward the equip , so that no warm surround air is mix into the air flow . the invent also relat to a special air guid devic intend to be use at such a system , and a procedur for cool , which procedur is base on what is appli in the system .
