apparatu and method for estim the number of object includ in an imag an apparatu and method for estim the number of object in an input imag are disclos . the apparatu includ : a learn unit that calcul count valu of a linear regress function by learn an arbitrari imag ; a separ unit that separ a foreground region and a background region of the input imag ; an extract unit that search for featur that requir an amount of calcul that is below a particular threshold from featur have high correl with each other featur and extract the featur from the separ foreground region ; and an estim unit that estim the number of object in the foreground region as a depend variabl by alloc the count valu of the linear regress function that are calcul by the learn unit and the featur that are extract by the extract unit as independ variabl of a linear regress function .
