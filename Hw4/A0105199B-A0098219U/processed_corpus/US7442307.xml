method and apparatu for the biolog activ sludg treatment of wastewat the equip ha a main reaction ( i ) and an anterior reactor ( ii ) , as well as facil for feed in untreat sewag , remov clean water and sludg and aerat the wastewat enter into the main reactor , and a mixer ( 2 ) situat in the anterior reactor ( ii ) , and it is character by that between the main reactor ( i ) and the anterior reactor ( ii ) there is a facil or there are facilit for the recircul of wastewat . in the cours of the procedur , between the anterior reactor ( ii ) and the main reactor ( i ) the waste-wat aerat in the latter reactor and mechan stir in the former reactor is recircul , and so the transform of the nitrogen content of the biolog decompos pollut by nitrif take place in the main reactor , while the biolog elimin of the nitrat creat in the cours of the nitrif ( denitrif ) take place in the anterior reactor , and as a result of the anaerob process biolog phosphoru elimin is also ensur ( fig . 1 ) .
