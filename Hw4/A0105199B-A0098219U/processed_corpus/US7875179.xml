side stream type membran bioreactor process the invent provid a side stream type membran bioreactor process which doe not caus an excess fall in the mlss concentr in a bioreactor , doe not requir ani addit effluent treatment facil for discharg backwash effluent , and can further ensur the stabil of the membran filtrat perform of a separ membran . accord to the invent , in a side stream type membran bioreactor process , a backwash effluent contain foulant that are gener by backwash a separ membran is collect in a backwash effluent tank , and subject to ozon treatment , and the result is return to a bioreactor . by thi ozon treatment , the foulant close to the membran pore size of the separ membran are made fine or are made into a state be easili taken into activ sludg floc . therefor , even when the treat effluent is return to the bioreactor , the membran filtrat perform of the separ membran is not deterior .
