sub-micron filter aluminum hydroxid fiber approxim 2 nanomet in diamet and with surfac area rang from 200 to 650 m.sup.2/g have been found to be highli electroposit . when dispers in water they are abl to attach to and retain electroneg particl . when combin into a composit filter with other fiber or particl they can filter bacteria and nano size particul such as virus and colloid particl at high flux through the filter . such filter can be use for purif and steril of water , biolog , medic and pharmaceut fluid , and as a collector/concentr for detect and assay of microb and virus . the alumina fiber are also capabl of filter sub-micron inorgan and metal particl to produc ultra pure water . the fiber are suitabl as a substrat for growth of cell . macromolecul such as protein may be separ from each other base on their electroneg charg .
