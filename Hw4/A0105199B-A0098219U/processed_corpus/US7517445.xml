mediat electrochem oxid of food wast materi a mediat electrochem oxid process is use to treat , oxid and destroy food wast materi , such as manur , biolog residu , hay , straw , anim byproduct , bone , horn , blood , biolog item , patholog wast and combin wast . food wast is introduc into an apparatu for contact the wast with an electrolyt contain the oxid form of one or more revers redox coupl , at least one of which is produc by anod oxid in an electrochem cell . the oxid speci of the redox coupl oxid the organ wast molecul and are themselv convert to their reduc form , whereupon they are reoxid by either of the aforement mechan and the redox cycl continu until all oxidiz wast speci , includ intermedi reaction product , have undergon the desir degre of oxid . the process take place at temperatur between zero degre centigrad and below the boil point of the electrolyt .
