mediat electrochem oxid and destruct of sharp sharp are introduc into an apparatu for contact the sharp with an electrolyt contain the oxid form of one or more revers redox coupl , at least one of which is produc electrochem by anod oxid at the anod of an electrochem cell . the oxid form of ani other redox coupl present are produc either by similar anod oxid or reaction with the oxid form of other redox coupl present and capabl of affect the requir redox reaction . the oxid speci of the redox coupl oxid sharp and the biolog wast on the sharp and are themselv convert to their reduc form , whereupon they are reoxid by either of the aforement mechan and the redox cycl continu until all oxidiz wast speci , includ intermedi reaction product , have undergon the desir degre of oxid . the entir process take place at temperatur between ambient and approxim 100.degre . c. the oxid process will be enhanc by the addit of reaction enhanc , such as : ultrason energi and/or ultraviolet radiat .
