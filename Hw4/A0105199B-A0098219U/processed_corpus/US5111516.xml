apparatu for visual recognit a basic imag of object is extract from a two-dimension imag of object . geometr element of the object are extract from the extract basic imag . the object to be recogn are identifi by search a combin of the geometr element which match a geometr model and then util candid position/orient of the object to be recogn , said candid position/orient be determin from a relationship in rel posit between the combin of geometr element and the geometr model . mesh cell fix to the geometr model are map on the basic imag base on the candid position/orient . in addit , verif is made as to whether an imag of the geometr model map by the candid position/orient is accur match with an imag of one of the object to be recogn , through a neural network to which valu got from the basic imag includ in the individu mesh cell are to be appli as input valu . combin weight factor employ in the neural network are learn accord to the verifi result . it is also possibl to recogn the multi-purpos object accord to how to learn the combin weight factor .
