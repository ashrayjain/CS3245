method and apparatu for produc a flat fan paint spray pattern a method and apparatu for spray a coat materi such as paint , in a flat fan pattern . in the gun a stream of paint under a rel low pressur is caus to flow in an annular film . stream of ga at a slightli higher pressur are direct against the paint film so that the ga is shear into microbubbl which are entrain in the paint stream to form a froth . the froth flow through a chamber in which the bubbl dispers uniformli in the paint and is then discharg through a narrow slit nozzl effect to give it a fan shape . as the froth is releas to atmospher pressur , the microbubbl of air expand rapidli and ruptur , caus the paint to disintegr into fine atom drop . the apparatu includ a cooper orific plate and collar which defin a thin annular paint flow channel ; and a plural of air inject channel which intersect the paint flow channel . air is introduc through these channel and is direct against the paint film . in the prefer gun , the nozzl includ a hemispher endwis portion provid with an elong discharg slot . a protuber or ball is dispos within the nozzl and deflect the froth so that the froth pass through a rel narrow passageway between the ball and nozzl . a modifi gun includ a convent airless flat fan orific ; and doe not util an intern ball .
