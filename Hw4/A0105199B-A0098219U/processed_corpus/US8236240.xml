method and system for conduct vapor phase decontamin of sealabl entiti and their content the invent provid a method and system for conduct a continu oper , flow vapor phase decontamin in either an open loop or a close loop . use the method , a multi-compon liquid decontamin is vapor and deliv into , through and out of a sealabl enclosur by mean of a carrier ga that is flow into , through and out of said sealabl enclosur . after leav the enclosur , the vapor is captur in a cold-wat bath and decompos . the invent humidifi the carrier ga by pass it through a temperatur control water bath to warm , or to cool , the carrier ga as necessari in order to bring the carrier ga to the desir temperatur and humid befor it is combin with the vapor steril and allow to flow into the sealabl enclosur . the concentr of the vapor steril and the percent satur of the vapor steril are simultan control by control the rate at which the carrier ga flow and the rate at which the liquid steril is vapor . a chill mirror or other type of dew point sensor can be use to ensur that near satur condit are maintain dure decontamin .
