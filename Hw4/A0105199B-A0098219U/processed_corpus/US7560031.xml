process for treat pond water a process for the treatment of phosphor acid plant pond water facilit the recoveri of phosphoru valu from the input pond water . in certain aspect the process recycl solid from a later stage neutral and separ into the clarifi liquid stream from an initi clarif and neutral stage . a suffici amount of solid are ad to the clarifi liquid stream to effect the ph-depend precipit of a phosphat product . in altern aspect an intermedi ph-depend precipit of a phosphat product is achiev through the addit of a neutral agent . the phosphat product is further character by a low concentr of fluorid . in addit the phosphat product can be further process to a high puriti technic grade phosphor acid . in certain aspect the process employ floccul agent to enhanc the format of precipit . in further aspect , methodolog taught herein facilit the reduct of silica in the process stream . process accord to the present invent are further character by an enhanc recoveri of treat water , reduc sludg impound and reduc lime consumpt when compar to convent doubl lime process .
