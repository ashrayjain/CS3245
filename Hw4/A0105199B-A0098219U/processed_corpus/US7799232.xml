method of treat wastewat with reduc water purif materi a reduc water purif materi have a reduc iron-bas precipit select from green rust , iron ferrit , reduc iron hydroxid , and a mixtur thereof . a wastewat treatment process have step of ad a reduc iron compound to wastewat , lead the wastewat to which the reduc iron compound is ad to a reaction tank and form a precipit , separ the form precipit by a solid-liquid separ to obtain a sludg , and alkalin all or a portion of the separ sludg to form an alkalin sludg follow by return to the reaction tank , wherein in the precipit step , the wastewat to which the reduc iron compound is ad and the alkalin sludg are mix and are allow to react in a non-oxid atmospher under alkalin condit to form a reduc iron compound precipit as the precipit , therebi incorpor contamin in the precipit to remov the contamin from the wastewat .
