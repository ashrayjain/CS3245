method for the treatment of ammonia-contain wast water a method for treat ammonium-contain wast water by mean of a singl sludg system in an sbr reactor , in which ammonium is convert to nitrit in a first reaction and ammonium and nitrit are convert into molecular nitrogen in a second reaction carri out in parallel , the oxygen concentr in the reactor be maintain at a low level . a robust process is achiev by provid that the ph-valu of the system is control and kept at a target valu by control intermitt aerat , the fluctuat rang of the ph-valu amount to 0.05 at most , and prefer 0.02 at most , and the o2-concentr be kept between 0.2 mg/l and 0.4 mg/l , and prefer between 0.25 mg/l and 0.35 mg/l .
