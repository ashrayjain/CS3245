apparatu and method for purifi water in a storag tank a pressur water tank have a head space includ a pump for recircul the water through a nozzl dispos in the head space . the out flow stream of water will entrain air and caus mix of air entrain water with the remain water in the tank . to enhanc air entrain and convey the air entrain water to a locat well below the water level , the stream of water is inject into a vertic venturi tube . the entrain air will have an oxid effect upon organ matter and also caus circul of the water within the tank . to enhanc oxid of organ and inorgan matter , a uv lamp may be locat in the head space to convert oxygen molecul in the air into ozon molecul . such ozon molecul would be entrain in the stream of water flow out of the nozzl and into the tube and have a strong oxid effect upon organ and inorgan matter . uv radiat from the uv lamp will also have a virucid and germicid effect upon microorgan on the surfac of the water and in water to some depth below the water surfac .
