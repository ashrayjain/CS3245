bio tank/oxygen replenish system a system is disclos herein for treat wastewat liquid by util aerob biolog speci . the contamin wastewat stream is pretreat in a dissolv air flotat system to remov suspend solid wast , includ larg particl such as fat , greas , and physic emulsifi oil . the purifi wastewat contain dissolv wast is thereaft oxygen and further decontamin in a bioreactor tank . biolog speci in the bioreactor tank consum oxygen and perform bodili function that convert dissolv wast into easili remov carbon dioxid and suspend solid . oxygen consum by the biolog speci is replenish by pump the wastewat though a liquid-oxygen mixer . a control regul the speed of the pump base on real-tim oxygen concentr measur provid by a correspond oxygen probe dispos within the wastewat in the bioreactor tank .
