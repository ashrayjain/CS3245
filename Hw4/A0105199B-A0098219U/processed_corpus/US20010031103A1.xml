textur descript method and texture-bas imag retriev method use gabor filter in frequenc domain a textur descript method in a frequenc domain for extract textur featur by transform and gabor-filt an input imag into an imag of the frequenc domain , and a texture-bas retriev method thereof are provid . the textur descript method in the frequenc domain includ : a first step of transform an imag of a time domain into an imag of the frequenc domain ; a second step of filter the transform imag use a gabor filter have n.times.m filter region , where n and m are respect predetermin posit integ ; a third step of extract featur valu of the imag that ha been gabor-filt in respect channel of the frequenc domain divis layout correspond to the n.times.m filter region of the gabor filter ; and a fourth step of decid a textur descriptor of the imag on the basi of the featur valu of the imag .
