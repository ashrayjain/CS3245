system of convert anim wast to energi and use by-product a system and method for convert anim wast , in the form of wast slurri , to energi and use byproduct . a screen mesh filter out larg object from wast slurri and the filter slurri is chop and fragment to reduc bind of fibrou materi . the fragment slurri is mix at a rate to maintain solid in the fragment slurri in suspens while minim aerat and turbul within the mix unit . a solid recoveri unit recov about 95 % of the suspend solid . a polym is introduc into the solid recoveri unit for provid agglomer of solid particl . the recov solid are gasifi to produc at least methane/ethan ga . the produc ga is provid to an energi product unit to gener electr and/or heat energi . liquid remain after the solid recoveri is treat to remov undesir contamin to an extent in complianc with water qualiti standard set for anim wast flush , anim wash and anim drink water , as the case may be .
