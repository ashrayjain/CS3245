atom techniqu for produc fine particl thi disclosur relat to a novel process for atom a liquid materi or a mixtur of liquid materi . more specif , thi disclosur advanc the art by util the inerti forc creat in an elev acceler environ to further miniatur and enhanc the characterist of particl result from atom . the key to thi disclosur is to subject a melt materi to an elev acceler and pass a fluid over the surfac of the melt . the purpos of the elev acceler is to elev the rel import of gravit forc in the melt thu miniatur ani graviti influenc disturb . thi elev acceler environ lead to miniatur of gravit depend phenomena thu lead to smaller particl creation . the purpos of the atom fluid is to impart kinet energi onto the melt therebi caus disturb and to act as a heat transfer media to cool the particl . in other word , thi disclosur teach not onli util burst bubbl , surfac wave , and splash to creat fine particl by purpos introduc ga flow on the liquid materi ( s ) to be atom but further enhanc the process by facilit that these materi ( s ) are simultan at elev acceler . the novel aspect of thi disclosur significantli enhanc the physic characterist of the result particl , by allow smaller particl to be produced. , by cool the particl more rapidli and by reduc contamin threat by avoid physic contact between the materi ( s ) be atom and ani refract materi .
