system and method for biolog wastewat treatment and for use the byproduct thereof a wastewat treatment system and process includ a treatment system for biolog treat wastewat to produc substanti clean water effluent and byproduct . the treatment system includ an array of rotat media wheel for sustain alga growth . the media wheel are support so that the alga rotat into and out of the wastewat for exposur to sunlight . one byproduct is alga remov from the rotat media wheel , which may be provid to other process facil to produc , for instanc , bio-diesel fuel . wast co.sub.2 may also be provid to the facil for enhanc alga growth . bacteria is provid to form a symbiot relationship with the alga , fuel by sunlight to effect remov toxic materi from the wastewat . rotat of the media wheel can be accomplish by air jet that also oper to dislodg excess alga as a byproduct of the system and process .
