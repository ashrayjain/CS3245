method of sequest carbon dioxid in aqueou environ the present invent provid a method of sequest carbon dioxid in aqueou environ . in a first step , an area is assess to determin whether the area is capabl of support the addit of organ of higher trophic level ( ohtl ) . next , ohtl are ad to the area in order to produc enough rapidli sink and refractori particul matter ( pm ) to sequest carbon dioxid abov the level of carbon dioxid sequestr that exist befor the addit of ohtl . prefer , the pm produc by the ohtl sink at rate significantli greater than and/or is significantli less biodegrad than that produc by other compon of the biolog carbon pump . final , thi increas in the level of carbon dioxid sequestr is quantifi . the method of the present invent may also includ the step of report the quantifi increas in the level of carbon dioxid sequestr .
