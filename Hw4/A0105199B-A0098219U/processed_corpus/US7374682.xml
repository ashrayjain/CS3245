method and apparatu for the methan ferment treatment of wastewat contain sulfur compound a method and apparatu for the anaerob methan ferment treatment of a wastewat contain a sulfur compound . an oxid agent is ad to an organ wastewat to oxid the sulfur compound contain therein to molecular sulfur befor the anaerob treatment step . the wastewat is then introduc into the anaerob treatment step for the methan ferment treatment thereof . the amount of the oxid agent to be ad to the wastewat is control use as an indic the concentr of the residu oxid agent in the water flow into the anaerob treatment step and/or the concentr of hydrogen sulfid in a bioga gener . the oxid agent may be ozon , hydrogen peroxid , sodium hypochlorit or a bromin base oxid agent . when the concentr of hydrogen sulfid in a bioga gener in the anaerob treatment step is use as said indic , the oxid agent may be suitabl ad such that the concentr of hydrogen sulfid is 3 % or less .
