method for produc monodispers microbubbl and nanobubbl by mean of rotari co-flow mtodo para la produccin de micro- y nano-burbuja monodispersa mediant co-flujo giratorio the subject matter of thi invent is a method for produc micro-bubbl of uniform size by use a coaxial flow of liquid that is subject to a high angular veloc in the direct of the current , a much smaller size of bubbl be gener than that produc by ani other method involv co-flow . the ga that form the microbubbl is inject coaxial via a capillari tube posit in the vicin of a gener circular orific or axisymmetr converg nozzl , via which the rotari coaxial current of liquid and the ga bubbl are discharg . rotat of the liquid gener a high vacuum in the axi of rotat , form extraordinarili fine jet of ga that give rise to bubbl that are veri small by comparison . thi invent can be appli in mani technolog field , for exampl the food , pharmaci , biomedicin , diagnosi , chemic engin and environment field .
