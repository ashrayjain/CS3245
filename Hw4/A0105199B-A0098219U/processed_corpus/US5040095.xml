thermal control equip cabinet a thermal control equip cabinet for telephon system ha a gas-tight , seal compart for mount sensit activ electron compon and ha jacket 20 partial encompass at least three side of the seal compart . the seal compart util either forc or natur convect to dissip the heat gener by the compon to the surround air . the heat is then dissip to the ambient air through a highli heat-conduct corrug roof and side panel . the jacket provid a cool air passag around the seal compart and over the corrug roof remov heat thereof . nonsensit passiv compon , mount in the cool air passag near the air inlet of the jacket , provid protrus in the cool air passag caus a slightli turbul air flow in the passag therebi enhanc heat transfer . storag batteri , such as use in telephon system , are mount within the cool air passag near the air exhaust of the jacket . the warmer air allow the batteri oper at higher and more effici oper temperatur .
