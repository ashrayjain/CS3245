devic and method for manag the electr brake of a vehicl the invent relat to a devic for manag electr brake power ( 1 ) , which devic compris a continu bu ( 10 ) , said continu bu includ : a connect pole ( 12 ) connect to an electr traction machin ( 21 ) of a vehicl , said machin be associ with an invert ( 20 ) which , in brake mode , deliv an electr brake power over the continu bu ; a connect pole ( 13 ) connect to an electr power storag batteri ( 30 ) ; a dissip branch ( 1d ) connect at a connect point ( 11 ) to the continu bu , said branch includ an electron dissip switch ( 1d1 ) connect in seri with a dissip resistor ( 1d2 ) ; a current collector ( 15 ) on the continu bu , dispos between the connect point ( 11 ) of the continu bu and the connect pole ( 13 ) connect to a batteri ; and a control ( 18 ) . the devic also includ an electron charg switch ( 1c1 ) between the connect point at which the dissip branch ( 1d ) is connect to the continu bu ( 10 ) and the connect pole connect to a batteri of the continu bu , said switch control the flow of current over the continu bu from the connect pole connect to an electr machin to the connect pole connect to a batteri . the control evalu the differ between the recharg current limit of the batteri and the current on the continu bu , such as to leav the electron charg switch close while the current on the continu bu is below the recharg current limit of the batteri .
