devic for thermal manag of a vehicl equip with a fuel cell thermal manag system for cool the ancillari in a electr vehicl fuel cell compris independ cool for traction motor and batteri and locat of electron cool in main cool circuit the main cool liquid is not in chemic contact with the fuel cell and may therefor be a water glycol mixtur which doe not requir a phase separ . the electron compon cool unit ( 28 ) is place in the main cool circuit and the batteri and motor are separ cool ( 50,29 ) . heat from the fuel cell ( 1 ) is use in the first instanc to heat the cabin ( 18 ) , then discharg extern ( 13 ) and sent final to an exchang ( 21 ) and compressor ( 38 ) . independ claim are also includ for the follow : a vehicl equip with the thermal manag system ; a method for manag the thermal requir on a fuel cell vehicl .
