acid mine water deminer the acid mine water deminer apparatu consist of two concentr cylind that are divid into a total of four section ; a water chamber , a ga chamber , a reaction zone , and an aerat zone . the water chamber transport acid mine water to the inlet of a plural of the sharp edg orific . the ga chamber receiv ozon from an extern sourc and send it through a porou plate into the reaction zone , thu ensur the ga is dispers uniformli throughout the reaction zone . water pass through the sharp edg orific into the reaction zone react with the ozon to oxid the insolubl metal in the water . exit the reaction zone , the water enter into the aerat zone where addit oxygen is ad to the water and the agit of the water is calm befor it enter a settl tank .
