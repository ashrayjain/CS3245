channel polym fiber as stationary/support phase for chemic separ by liquid chromatographi and for wast stream clean-up polym fiber have a novel cross-sect geometri are use as stationari phase materi for liquid chromatographi separ . fiber of 20 to 50 micromet diamet have surface-channel structur extend their entir length . bundl of fiber have thi novel cross-sect geometri are pack in column . differ polym composit permit the `` chemic tune '' of the separ process . channel fiber compos of polystyren and polypropylen have been use to separ mixtur of polyaromat hydrocarbon ( pah ) , pb-contain compound and fatti acid . use of channel fiber allow a wide rang of liquid flow rate with veri low back pressur . applic in hplc , cap-lc , prep-scal separ , analyt separ , singl fiber separ , wast remediation/immobil , extract of select organ molecules/ion from solut , purif of liquid stream ( process wast , drink water , pure solvent ) , select extract of cell matter and bacteria from growth media , and immobil of cell matter and bacteria are envis .
