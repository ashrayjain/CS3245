photocatalyst materi have semiconductor characterist and method for manufactur and use the same new type of photocatalyst materi are disclos togeth with method for prepar and use these materi , as well as air treatment system incorpor such materi . the photocatalyst materi of thi invent consist essenti of veri small particl of a first-met oxid , the first-met be a metal that exhibit photo-induc semiconductor properti , have ion of a second-met dispers throughout it lattic structur , the second-met be select from the group of dopant metal . such photocatalyst materi are prepar by the step of mix first-met and second-met precursor , remov nonessenti ion from the mixtur , dri the result product , and calcin the dri product to produc the complet photocatalyst materi .
