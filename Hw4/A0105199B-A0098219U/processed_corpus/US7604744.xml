system and method for process organ wast materi a method is provid for maintain a biomass dispos on a substrat in a bioreactor tank . the bioreactor tank ha an inlet and an outlet in fluid commun with a wast treatment system wherebi an influent fluid may be select introduc through the inlet into the bioreactor tank for remov of wast materi therefrom . thi produc an effluent fluid which can be return through the outlet to the wast treatment system . the method compris process a quantiti of influent fluid through the bioreactor tank to produc a quantiti of effluent fluid and remov the effluent fluid from the bioreactor tank through the outlet . the method further compris isol the bioreactor tank from the wast treatment system and establish a set of dri cycl condit in the bioreactor tank . the dri cycl condit are select to effect endogen growth within at least a portion of the biomass wherebi an averag age of the at least a portion of the biomass may be tailor . the method also compris restor the bioreactor tank connect to the wast treatment system .
