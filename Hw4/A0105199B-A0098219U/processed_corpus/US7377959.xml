process and apparatu for decomposit treatment of volatil chlorin organ compound a larg amount of a medium contain a volatil chlorin organ compound ( voc ) with a low concentr is pass through an adsorb fill with an adsorb which adsorb and desorb the voc to collect the voc in the medium in the adsorb ; a ga contain water vapor is then brought into contact with the adsorb to desorb and discharg the voc from the adsorb ; the desorb ga is cool to condens the voc and water ; a small amount of the voc with a high concentr vapor from the condens is further irradi with light in the presenc of chlorin to decompos the voc ; and the decompos product is subsequ treat . thi constitut can allow a larg amount of the voc with a low concentr to be irradi with light in the presenc of chlorin to effici treat the voc .
