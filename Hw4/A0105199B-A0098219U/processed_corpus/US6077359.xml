procedur and devic for the chemic and electrolyt treatment of print circuit board and conductor film a method of treatment of print circuit board or conductor film with a chemic , electrolyt , or rins treatment liquid , and to a devic for carri out the method , where the print circuit board or conductor film are transport in a horizont direct by transport mean , in order to acceler these process , the surfac of the print circuit board or conductor film must be expos to a macroflow in order to appli activ treatment liquid . furthermor , the micromateri exchang into the diffus layer must be reinforc . thi exchang is brought about by the use of hydrodynam act cavit gener , which form cavit bubbl in the liquid jet . the treatment liquid is set into an eddi current movement in the gener becaus the treatment liquid is appli at high pressur in a circuit through the nozzl gener the cavit bubbl , and is convey to the surfac in a larg quantiti . the use of the method is particularli effect in process fine conductor print circuit board with fine bore and blind hole .
