feedback system for enhanc elimin of biomass in sewag sludg already-tr sludg is fed back into incom sewag , and is effect to suppli nutrient need for the microbiolog breakdown of the sludg . the feedback sludg ha a solid content of 10 % or more , and ha been shear and heat to drive it viscos down to 10,000 cp or less . in sludg done that way , nutrient are preserv and present to the sewag to be treat in highli liquid and solubil form , wherebi the nutrient are veri bio-avail to the microb in the sewag . larg improv in the elimin of biomass can result .
