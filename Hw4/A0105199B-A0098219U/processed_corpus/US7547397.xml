particle-acceler deposit and separ apparatu and method for turbid water a pretreat particle-acceler deposit and separ apparatu and method for purifi turbid raw water , which base on the theori of laminar flow requir , particle-acceler vertic deposit and water horizont movement , separ water molecul from turbid particl in a laminar flow region ( with a reynold number lower than 1,000 ) . by acceler the veloc of high-turbid raw water and the turbid particl , the particl settl vertic becaus of inertia . thu , the turbid particl can be remov physic from the raw water and clean water can be collect at differ height of the apparatu while concentr turbid water can be releas to a nearbi bodi of water after appropri treatment . therebi , turbid water can be purifi for the subsequ coagul , sediment and filtrat process in tradit water treatment plant .
