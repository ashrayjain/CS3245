method and a devic for destruct of organ materi in inject water a method and a devic ( 2 ) for destruct of organ materi in inject water for an inject well ( 4 ) , in which a mean ( 10 ) for introduct of water in the inject well ( 4 ) , and at least one electrochem cell ( 16 ) with associ oper mean are use for in situ electrolyt gener from water of at least short-liv , free hydroxyl radic . the distinct characterist of the invent is that it compris the follow step : ( a ) to connect the at least one electrochem cell ( 16 ) to the inject well ( 4 ) ; and ( b ) by mean of said oper mean , to conduct the inject water through said cell ( 16 ) for in situ gener of at least free hydroxyl radic from the inject water , insofar as free hydroxyl radic immedi destruct organ materi that they engag in the inject water . the invent also compris use of water , which is to be inject into an inject well ( 4 ) , as a sourc materi for in situ electrolyt gener of said hydroxyl radic for immedi destruct of organ materi in the inject water .
