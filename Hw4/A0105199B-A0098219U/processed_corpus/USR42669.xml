vertic cylindr skein of hollow fiber membran and method of maintain clean fiber surfac a gas-scrub vertic cylindr skein of `` fiber '' ha their oppos termin portion held in header unconfin in a modular shell , and aerat with a cleans ga suppli by a gas-distribut mean which produc a mass of bubbl serv the function of a scrub-brush for the outer surfac of the fiber . the skein is surprisingli effect with rel littl cleans ga , the specif flux through the membran reach an essenti constant rel high valu becaus the vertic deploy of fiber allow bubbl to rise upward along the outer surfac of the fiber . the effect is critic depend upon the length of each fiber in the skein . that length is in the rang from at least 0.1 % more than the fix distanc between oppos face of the skein 's header , but less than 5 % greater than the fix distanc . lack of tension allow the fiber to sway in bubbl flow along their outer surfac make them surprisingli resist to be foul by buildup of deposit of inanim particl or microorgan in the substrat . for use in a larg reservoir , a bank of skein is use with a ga distributor mean which ha fiber prefer > 0.5 meter long , which togeth provid a surfac area > 10 m.sup.2 . the termin end portion of fiber in each header are kept free from fiber-to-fib contact with a novel method of form a header .
