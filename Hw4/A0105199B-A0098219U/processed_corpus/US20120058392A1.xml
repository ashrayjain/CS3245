recharg batteri with aluminium anod , graphit cathod and an electrolyt contain aluminium vapour in plasma state we propos a recharg batteri with aluminium anod . in order to avoid the high reactiv of aluminium ion with most liquid electrolyt , we present an electrolyt contain aluminium vapour in plasma state . the batteri is contain in a quartz cylind heat with microwav to a suffici high temperatur to ionis the aluminium ion in the vapour . the anod is graphit . by receiv electron from the extern circuit , carbon atom in the graphit hexagon structur receiv 1 or 2 or 3 neg charg and combin with aluminium ion from the electrolyt . four charg in the carbon atom correspond to al.sub.4c.sub.3 , aluminium carbid , which can also be found . it ha a melt point of 2100.degre . c. , it is a solid at the plasma temperatur and stick to the anod .
