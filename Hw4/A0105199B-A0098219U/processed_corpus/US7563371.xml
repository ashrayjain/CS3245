tubular anaerob digest a tubular plug flow digest system assembl from manufactur compon , includ a holding/h tank ( 15 ) connect to a manifold ( 14 ) that feed a singl or multipl parallel inject pump ( 12 ) . these pump forc feedstock though check valv ( 13 ) and into singl or parallel digest hull . thi hull are compos of manufactur part includ taper end section ( 11 ) and hull section ( 10 ) that can be assembl onsit to a configur that accommod oper need . bioga produc by thi digest is pressur due to a liquid column creat by an elev effluent outlet ( 25 ) . feedstock is inocul with relev microorgan that promot the gener of methane-rich bioga . inocul member ( 26 ) posit within the hull shelter biofilm contain these microb while allow region of the biofilm to slough or natur releas microb into the flow feedstock stream . bioga is collect through a manifold ( 22 ) and it releas is control by a regul or a valv .
