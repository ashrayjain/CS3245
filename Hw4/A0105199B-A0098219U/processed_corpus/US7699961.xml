apparatu for concentr water-solubl organ materi a water-solubl organ materi condens apparatu equip with a distil column for distil an aqueou solut of a water-solubl organ materi , wherein a vapor gener at the top of the distil column or a condens liquid from the vapor is introduc to a devic other than the distil column which ha the function to separ water from the water-solubl organ materi to therebi condens the water-solubl organ materi through separ water and then the condens water-solubl organ materi is recycl to the distil column . the devic other than the distil column is desir a separ film such as a zeolit film . the apparatu is improv in the oper of the upper portion of the condens section of the distil column and allow energi save dure distil .
