differenti hemolysi of a whole blood sampl the invent relat to a method for differenti hemolyz whole blood . it disclos method for detect an analyt in a liquid sampl known or suspect to contain red blood cell and suspect or known to contain eukaryot cell , the method includ the step of process the liquid sampl with a membran solubil agent under condit appropri to lyse cell membran of red blood cell and at the same time not to caus precipit of sampl constitu , subject the process sampl to a chromatograph separ , and detect the analyt . the differenti hemolysi of red blood cell is of advantag in a method of detect an analyt in a liquid sampl that may contain both erythrocyt and nucleat cell . the differenti solubil of red blood cell can be easili combin with an onlin detect methodolog , like lc-m , and is advantag in the detect of mani analyt , e.g . in the detect of folat or of immunosuppress drug , like tacrolimu or sirolimu .
