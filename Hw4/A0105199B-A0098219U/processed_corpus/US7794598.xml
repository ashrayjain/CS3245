bioreactor and method for the biolog purif of water the invent relat to a bioreactor ( 1 ) for the purif of water , said reactor compris a cross-sect essenti circular or ellipt tank section ( 2 ) provid with inlet mean ( 5 ) for water to be purifi and outlet mean ( 6 ) for purifi water . the tank hold thereinsid carrier materi ( 3 ) on which a biofilm may develop . the tank is further provid with mean ( 4 ) for suppli a fluid which contain a reaction ga requir by the purif process , such that the water to be purifi develop ga bubbl contain a reaction ga . the tank section is adapt to be essenti full of water dure the purif process . the fluid suppli mean ( 4 ) are dispos on the tank wall and the reactor compris control mean for oper the fluid suppli mean in such a way that a spin motion of the carrier , the water , and at least some of said reaction-ga bear bubbl is effect therebi around a rotat centerlin pass essenti through the tank 's cross-sect center . the control mean are adapt to option effect a deactiv of the fluid suppli mean at desir time and/or a replac of the fluid with an oxygen-fre fluid for provid an anaerob process . the invent relat also to a method for the biolog purif of water in a bioreactor .
