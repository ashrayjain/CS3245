separ system and effici captur of contamin use magnet nanoparticl method are disclos for the captur , detect , separ , isol and quantif of contamin in a start materi . also disclos are competit assay method for the detect and quantif of contamin in a start materi . kit for use with the method are disclos as well . a system for captur , separ and/or concentr contamin from a materi is also present . the system captur , separ and/or concentr contamin such as bacteria , virus , other microorgan , and/or larger item , such as insect , from a varieti of materi , such as food , and environment and clinic materi . in gener , the system use a rotat magnet field to mix the materi with magnet particl to captur the target contamin , and a fix magnet field to separ and concentr the captur target contamin .
