suspend media granular activ carbon membran biolog reactor system and process a system and process for treat an industri wastewat stream is provid use a membran biolog reactor in which granular activ carbon materi is introduc into an aerat portion and maintain upstream of a membran oper system . the size of the granul of activ carbon is select so that they can be screen or otherwis readili separ from the mix liquor stream befor the mix liquor enter the membran oper system tank ( s ) contain the submerg membran , therebi prevent abras of the membran by the carbon granul . the aerat portion includ a wast discharg port wherebi a portion of spent granular activ carbon can be remov when the effluent concentr of chemic oxygen demand compound approach limit typic set by government agenc , and replac by addit of fresh or regener granular activ carbon have greater adsorb capac .
