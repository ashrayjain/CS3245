procedur and devic for the chemic and electrolyt treatment of print circuit board and film the invent pertain to a procedur for the rapid and high-precis chemic and electrolyt treatment and scour of print circuit board and film , use a treatment fluid through which the print circuit board and film are convey in a horizont posit and direct . the invent also pertain to a devic for carri out thi procedur . to speed up these process , the surfac of the articl undergo treatment must be expos to a macrostream deliv activ treatment fluid . in addit , micro-exchang of materi into the diffus layer must be promot . accord to the invent thi is achiev by use hydrodynam act cavit gener which produc cavit bubbl form in liquid jet ( 50 ) ; thi is done by forc the treatment fluid out of the gener under high pressur and caus the treatment fluid in the gener to move in eddi . the treatment fluid is forc under high pressur in a circul through cavit bubble-gener nozzl ( 10 ) and discharg in larg quantiti onto the surfac . the cavit bubbl in the fluid implod at the diffus layer and thu bring about the micro-exchang of materi . the process is particularli effect in the treatment of fine-conductor print circuit board with fine bore and blind hole .
