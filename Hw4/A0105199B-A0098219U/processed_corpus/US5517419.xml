advanc terrain map system a tractor and trailer togeth with a post-process system that use gp satellit togeth with a dead reckon system and associ camera and sensor to determin the exact locat of the system , translat thi locat inform onto sever photogrammetr map collector for the purpos of develop an orthograph databas imag that can be correl with other onboard sensor for determin the precis locat of terrain featur . the main sensor platform compris a gp receiv togeth with a plural of visual sensor and a dead reckon system mount on a trailer . the gp data and the dead reckon data are brought togeth in a navig system to provid precis locat of the system . the camera system on board the trailer of the system compris a seri of camera for record imag of the terrain as the trailer proce over the terrain of interest . dure data collect , digit imageri is transmit from each camera and receiv by an on-board comput . the collect of imag data is trigger by the movement of the vehicl a certain distanc along the ground . simultan with the collect of the digit imag data , the on-board gp system and dead reckon system are queri for geograph refer . a datafram is then creat and store for each form of imageri from each camera . dure post process , an oper can extract highli accur geograph coordin from a combin of photogrammetr techniqu use the store imag and geograph data . the system output hardcopi engin plot and softcopi digit vector file .
