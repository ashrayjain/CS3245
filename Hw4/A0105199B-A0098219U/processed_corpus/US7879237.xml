method for biolog dispos of organ wastewat and biolog dispos apparatu a biolog treatment method and devic for organ wastewat , wherebi the amount of minut organ which reduc the amount of excess sludg and held within an activ sludg tank can be stabil so that the treatment can be stabil , are provid . substrat for grow dispers bacteria and/or dispers bacteria are suppli to a sludg treatment tank 51 which reduc the sludg by the minut organ , so that the minut organ grow stabli and reduc the sludg . specif , a first and a second biolog treatment step are conduct respect in a first activ sludg tank 21 and a second biolog treatment tank 31 . the sludg includ in effluent which flow from the biolog step is separ in a sediment tank 41 . the gener sludg obtain is suppli to the sludg treatment tank 51 . the water to be treat which is bypass via a bypass path 26 is introduc to a sludg treatment tank 51 as substrat to be assimil by bacteria so that dispers bacteria are made to grow in the sludg treatment tank 51 and the minut organ are held stabli in the sludg treatment tank 51 to promot the reduct of sludg .
