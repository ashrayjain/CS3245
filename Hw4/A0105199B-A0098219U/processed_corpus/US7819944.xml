method of dehydr , dehydr apparatu , and membran reactor a dehydr method by which water is select separ from a water-contain mixtur 31 with a separ membran . the separ membran is a ddr type zeolit membran 2 . the dehydr method includ bring the mixtur 31 into contact with one side of the ddr type zeolit membran 2 and caus a pressur differ between that side of the ddr type zeolit membran 2 which is in contact with the mixtur and the other side of the ddr type zeolit membran 2 to therebi caus the water to select permeat and separ out . by the dehydr method , water can be select separ from a water-contain mixtur without the need of a high energi cost . the separ membran ha excel acid resist .
