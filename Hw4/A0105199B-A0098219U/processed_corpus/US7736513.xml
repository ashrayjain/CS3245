liquid-solid fluidiz bed wast water treatment system for simultan carbon , nitrogen and phosphor remov biolog nutrient remov ( bnr ) in wastewat treatment to remov carbonac substrat , nutrient and phosphoru , ha recent becom increasingli popular worldwid due to increasingli stringent regul . biolog fluidiz bed ( bfb ) technolog , which could be potenti use for bnr process , can provid some advantag such as high effici and compact structur . thi present invent incorpor the fixed-film biolog fluidiz bed technolog with the biolog nutrient remov in a twin liquid-solid fluidiz bed , which ha achiev the simultan elimin of organ carbon , nitrogen and phosphoru , in a veri effici manner and with veri compact space requir . the bnr-lsfb ha two fluidiz bed , run as anoxic/anaerob and aerob process to accomplish simultan nitrif and denitrif and to remov carbonac substrat , nutrient and phosphoru , with continu liquid and solid recircul through the anoxic/anaerob bed and the aerob bed . the new bnr-lsfb system is not onli an excel altern for convent activ sludg type bnr technolog but is also capabl of process much higher load and suitabl for industri applic .
