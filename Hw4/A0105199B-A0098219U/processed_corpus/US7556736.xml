process and system for convert biomass materi into energi to power marin vessel the process and system of the invent convert biomass materi into energi to power a larg marin vessel without the problemat environment releas of either liquid to the sea or greenhous gase to the atmospher . the biomass is convey to an on-board biomass storag facil and convert to synthesi ga in an on-board gasif unit to synthesi ga that is use as fuel for fuel cell to power the marin vessel . a portion of the biomass is sea biomass harvest from the sea and remov from the sea by on-board biomass remov mean that strain the biomass from the sea water and flip the biomass into a hold bin befor be convey to the biomass storag facil . a portion of the synthesi ga is convert to use product . these product are partial use as fuel for the fuel cell . the remain product are off-load at port facil where biomass wast materi are load on-board and convey to the biomass storag to serv as the remain portion of biomass .
