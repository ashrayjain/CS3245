double-sid self-cleans media double-sid , self-cleans media , and system incorpor the same for a rotat biolog contactor , are describ . the media includ a disk have cone-shap member extend perpendicularli from both major face thereof . two or more disk lock togeth , axial about a rotat central shaft , by connect cone-shap member space throughout the disk surfac have a socket at their base to receiv the top of the correspond connect cone-shap member on the adjac disk . the cone-shap member , by virtu of their length , space the disk a desir distanc . disk segment can link to one anoth along either straight and/or curv connect portion thereof . the geometri of the media provid free passag of the air and water dure each revolut , and while the base disk slice through the air and water , the project cone-shap member enter the air and water perpendicular to the direct of rotat and are wash clear of excess biomass dure each rotat .
