method and arrang for process nitrogen-concentr effluent in a sequenti fraction cycl biolog reactor the invent relat to a method for process nitrogen-concentr effluent by ammonia oxid into nitrit follow by nitrit denitrit in a gaseou nitrogen in a sequenti biolog reactor ( 1 ) consist in pour a process effluent volum in to the reactor by success volum fraction , in divid the entir process cycl into success sub cycl , wherein each sub-cycl compris a feed phase , an aerat phase for nitrif and an anoxia phase along which a carbon-contain sourc is introduc into the reactor for convert nitrit into nitrogen . the invent method also consist in evalu a nitrogen volum charg in the effluent to be process , mainli by measur the effluent conduct ( x ) and the flow rate ( q ) and in determin the number of feed phase of the entir cycl accord to nitrogen charg and to a minimum volum of liquid in the reactor in such a way that an inject nitrogen concentr is dilut in the liquid volum , wherein the volum phase nitrogen charg is howev suffici for produc a singl shot or peak of the ammonia charg favour for a nitrat biomass format in the reactor .
