method and devic for creat and analyz an at temeratur and pressur oxidation-reduct potenti signatur in hot water system for prevent corros disclos is a method of creat a real-tim oxidation-reduct potenti signatur in a hot water system to detect redox stress and inhibit corros in the hot water system . the method includ defin one or more oper protect zone in the hot water system . one or more of the oper protect zone includ an oxidation-reduct potenti probe that is oper to measur a real-tim oxidation-reduct potenti in the hot water system at oper temperatur and pressur . the probe transmit the measur real-tim potenti to the control , which analyz and interpret the transmit potenti to creat an oxidation-reduct potenti signatur for the hot water system . if the signatur doe not conform to an oxidation-reduct potenti set , the control is oper to feed one or more activ chemic speci into the hot water system .
