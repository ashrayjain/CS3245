method for treat water contain ammonium-nitrogen raw water contain ammonium-nitrogen is introduc into a nitrif tank and nitrif of nitrite-nitrogen by nitrit oxid bacteria is inhibit accord to inhibit of the ammonium-nitrogen , therebi conduct stabl nitrif of nitrou acid type at a high load by the action of ammonium oxid bacteria . carbon and/or bicarbon are ad into the nitrif tank 1 . the inorgan carbon concentr in the nitrif tank 1 is maintain at 35 mg-c/l or more . the nitrifi liquid thu obtain is introduc into a denitrif tank and denitrif reaction is conduct by the action of denitrifi bacteria with the remain ammonium-nitrogen as an electron donor and the nitrite-nitrogen as an electron acceptor .
