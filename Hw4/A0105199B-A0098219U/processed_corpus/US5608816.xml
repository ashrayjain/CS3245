apparatu for inspect a wire pattern accord to a micro-inspect and a macro-inspect perform in parallel piec of featur inform in a bi-level imag such as a width , a branch point and an end point of a wire pattern are detect in a design rule check section accord to a micro inspect to find out piec of featur inform depart from a design rule . also , featur code in the bi-level imag such as a corner of the wire pattern are detect in a specif shape detect section accord to a macro inspect . the featur inform are compar with piec of referenti featur inform pertain to a non-defect wire pattern in a first compar and judg section to judg whether the wire pattern indic by the featur inform is defect or non-defect . the featur code are compar with referenti featur code pertain to a non-defect wire pattern in a second compar and judg section to judg whether the wire pattern indic by the featur code is defect or non-defect . therefor , defect type and portion of the wire pattern can be detect by perform the macro inspect and the micro inspect in parallel without divid the wire pattern into process region .
