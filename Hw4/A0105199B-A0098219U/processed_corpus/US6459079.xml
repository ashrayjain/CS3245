shipboard chemic agent monitor-port ( scamp ) a portabl system for sampl the ambient air of a select environ for the presenc of unwant chemic warfar vapor , such as nerv or blister gase , is disclos . the excit for the electr element of the system can be origin from a batteri or from an ac excit . the system compris a detector unit have first and second ion mobil spectromet which simultan detect and monitor for the presenc of the chemic agent vapor so as to provid an accur and quick determin of the unwant chemic vapor within the select environ , without fals alarm to non-chem warfar agent vapor , which act as interfer . the system design also allow monitor in the presenc of electromagnet interfer ( emi ) .
