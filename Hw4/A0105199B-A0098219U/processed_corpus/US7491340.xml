method for treat a live organ use a fluid with increas oxygen concentr and reduc surfac tension a method for treat a live organ to increas nutrient ingest . the step of the method are first treat a fluid stream for use by at least one live organ , in a surfac tension modif gener ( stmg ) at a first pressur with a frequenc minim hydrogen bond of the fluid form a reduc surfac tension stream . the next step is flow the reduc surfac tension stream through a port reduc the first pressur to a second pressur and ad oxygen . after oxygen is ad , then flow the reduc surfac tension stream with oxygen at the second pressur into an inner chamber . the next step is flow the reduc surfac tension stream and oxygen from the inner chamber through a plural of funnel dispos in a wall of the inner chamber creat a turbid zone in an outer chamber , and wherein nano-s oxygen particl are dissolv into the stream .
