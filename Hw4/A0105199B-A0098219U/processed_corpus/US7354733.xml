method for sort and separ live cell we disclos method of sort or separ mixtur of live cell ( e.g. , eukaryot , prokaryot , mammalian , pathogen , bacteri , viral , etc. ) . we perform our method by activ cell-select photophor label , which photosensit and chemic reduc a photosensit metal compound to form metal grain , particl or crystal . the metal adher to the cell and form the basi for sort or separ differ cell type . photophor label may includ chemiluminesc agent such as peroxidas enzym activ with peroxidas substrat capabl of luminesc . photosensit metal compound may be present in a light-sensit matrix or emuls contain photosensitiz metal compound , which form metal grain , particl or crystal upon exposur to a develop solut . develop solut are formul to substanti allow live cell to remain viabl after exposur to the develop solut . our method are use in flow cytometri and fluoresc activ cell sort ( fac ) method , microdissect method , and for attract , sediment , deposit , layer , attach , adher , bond , bind , trap or suspend cell on surfac .
