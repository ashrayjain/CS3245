cyclic process for the effici gener of chlorin dioxid in dilut solut an effici cyclic process and relat composit for the in-situ gener of chlorin dioxid from dilut solut of chlorit anion at near neutral ph . the cyclic process provid a mean of safe and effect use of chlorin dioxid with reduc concern of chlorit accumul in the aqueou system . the disclos chemistri use to support the cyclic process can be appli independ or in variou combin that are effect inert . thi dramat reduc safeti concern sinc the chlorin dioxid is produc in-situ to the applic and in dilut concentr . also , the process allow for regener of inert anion such as bromid and chlorit therebi reduc oper cost .
