process for the high recoveri effici of sulfur from an acid ga stream a process for the recoveri of sulfur from an acid ga stream is disclos . the process includ a clau sulfur recoveri step in combin with a direct reduct step and a biolog sulfur recoveri step to provid a sweet ga stream have a veri low concentr of hydrogen sulfid and sulfur dioxid . the process includ react an acid ga steam with oxygen under such oxid condit to yield a combust ga compris hydrogen sulfid and sulfur dioxid . the combust ga is react under clau reaction condit to yield a reaction ga compris sulfur . sulfur is recov from the reaction ga to yield a clau tail ga compris hydrogen sulfid and sulfur dioxid . the clau tail ga is react under direct reduct reaction condit to yield a direct reduct ga compris sulfur . sulfur is recov from the direct reduct reaction ga to yield a tail ga compris a concentr of hydrogen sulfid . the direct reduct tail ga is contact with a lean absorb to therebi remov from the tail ga a portion of the hydrogen sulfid contain therein and to yield a sweet ga and a rich solvent compris dissolv hydrogen sulfid . the dissolv hydrogen sulfid of the rich solvent is biolog oxid to element sulfur by contact the rich solvent with sulfur bacteria under suitabl biolog oxid condit .
