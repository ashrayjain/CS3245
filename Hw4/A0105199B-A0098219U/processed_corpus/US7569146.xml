by-product from ferment still bottom the disclos invent is an improv method for treat ethanol distil still bottom by recov , through solid separ and pressur membran filtrat , potabl water from still bottom for human consumpt by bottl or for reus , and concentr the solid with benefici properti recov such as chemic , nutrient and medicin befor anaerob digest . the invent is an improv process becaus it can reduc the volum of solid to manag , recov the water from the ferment still bottom while pasteur , maintain the chemic arid physic properti of solid for benefici properti recoveri , improv ethanol and energi effici , and result in clean discharg to the environ includ carbon dioxid recoveri . a bioreactor produc a ga rich in methan fuel from the concentr to power the pressur tiltrat process and an aqueou ammonia solut to recov or recycl . thi invent improv environment qualiti , conserv energi , and produc a beverag water for bottl that can be of an organ origin with reliabl sourc and qualiti .
