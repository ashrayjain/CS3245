method of treat organ compound in wastewat a treatment method of organ compound includ in wast water , compris the step of : suppli wast water to an adsorb 2 fill with an adsorb 3 therein for adsorb the organ compound in the wast water by the adsorb 3 in the adsorb 2 , suppli a current between an anod 9 and a cathod 8 in water includ an electrolyt in an electrolyz 6 for electrolyz the water includ an electrolyt , and suppli an electrolyt result from electrolysi in the electrolyz 6 to the adsorb 3 in the adsorb 2 for contact the electrolyt with the adsorb 3 , so that the organ compound adsorb by the adsorb 3 are desorb or decompos .
