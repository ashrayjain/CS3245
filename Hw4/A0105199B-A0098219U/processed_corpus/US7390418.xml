method of reduc chemic oxygen contamin in water a method of clean water system and an oxid ( e.g. , a potassium monopersulf composit ) that is use for the method are present . when potassium monopersulf is use as the oxid , it prefer ha a low concentr ( < 0.5 wt . % ) of potassium oxodisulf byproduct that caus irrit . the low potassium oxodisulf concentr allow the composit to be use more liber than convent potassium monopersulf . to control the releas rate of the oxid , the oxid is form into a tablet and place in an enclosur . the enclosur ha pore such that water enter the enclosur at a control rate and dissolv the oxid . the oxid solut that is gener in the enclosur enter the water system through the pore . option , the composit may also includ a layer of coat materi either under or over the enclosur that further control the rate of oxid dissolut .
