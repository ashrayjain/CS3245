optim nutrient remov from wastewat method and system are provid for reduc ammonia partial by a denitrif process . a stream contain ammonia is contact with oxygen to form a first product stream in low dissolv oxygen condit . the ratio of oxygen to nitrogen is about 2.28 g o.sub.2/g n -- nh.sub.3 ( 2.28 gram of oxygen per gram of nitrogen in ammonia ) or less . the first product stream is then expos to organ matter in an amount of 0.57 g cod/g n -- nh.sub.3 ( 0.57 gram of chemic oxygen demand per gram of nitrogen in ammonia ) . thi microbi reaction ultim produc nitrogen ga , water , and carbon dioxid .
