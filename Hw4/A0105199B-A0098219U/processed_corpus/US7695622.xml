system and method for elimin sludg via ozon a system and method for the treatment and reduct of sludg via ozon in a wastewat treatment process is disclos . the sludg treatment system compris : a sludg ozon reactor coupl to an activ sludg treatment basin and adapt to receiv a liquid stream of sludg contain biosolid from the activ sludg treatment basin . the sludg treatment system also includ an ozone-enrich ga inject system oper coupl to the reactor and adapt to inject ozone-enrich ga into the liquid stream at or upstream of the sludg ozon reactor . the sludg ozon reactor is configur to allow effect gas-liquid contact between the ozone-enrich ga and the liquid stream so as to oxid the biosolid in the liquid stream and initi bacteri cell lysi therebi reduc the biosolid . upon reduct of the biosolid , the liquid stream is return via a return line to the activ sludg basin or other discharg point .
