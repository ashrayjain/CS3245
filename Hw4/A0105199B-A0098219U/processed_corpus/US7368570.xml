organometal complex as singlet oxygen sensit a seri of organometal complex and the singlet oxygen sensit properti of these complex are provid . complex with acetylaceton ligand give singlet oxygen quantum yield near uniti , whether excit the ligand-bas state or the lowest energi excit state ( mlct+.sup.3lc ) . the singlet oxygen quench rate for these .beta.-diketon complex are small , roughli three order of magnitud slower than the correspond phosphoresc quench rate . similar complex were prepar with glycin or pyridin tether to the ir ( iii ) center ( i.e . ( bsn ) .sub.2ir ( gli ) and ( bt ) .sub.2ir ( py ) cl , where gly=glycin , and py=pyridin ) . the glycin and pyridin deriv give high singlet oxygen yield .
