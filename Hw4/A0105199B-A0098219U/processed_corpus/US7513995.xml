air driven particl recircul for a septic tank outlet baffl or filter assembl an air driven particl recircul design to introduc air around a singl or multipl compart septic tank discharg outlet baffl or filter assembl . the air driven particl recircul caus a movement of wast particl and suspend solid to be forc away from the inlet of the outlet baffl or filter assembl to onli allow cleaner filter effluent to enter the secondari treatment system . the particl recircul perform a function normal carri out by a settl compart or clarifi zone associ in aerob type septic system . when instal in a singl or multipl compart septic tank util an aerob process , the particl recircul will remov wast particl from the discharg area caus cleaner discharg and a cleaner septic tank filter assembl or outlet baffl reduc potenti pre-matur failur or damag to the secondari treatment system . the particl recircul , use in conjunct with an aerob process , will result in dramat and lower coliform and e. coli bacteria level , as well as reduc level of oil , greas , settabl solid and suspend residu .
