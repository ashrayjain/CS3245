apparatu and method for form a batteri in an integr circuit a method and structur that provid a batteri within an integr circuit for provid voltag to low-curr electron devic that exist within the integr circuit . the method includ front-end-of-lin ( feol ) process for gener a layer of electron devic on a semiconductor wafer , follow by back-end-of-lin ( beol ) integr for wire connect the electron devic togeth to form complet electr circuit of the integr circuit . the beol integr includ form a multilay structur of wire level on the layer of electron devic . each wire level includ conduct metal ( e.g. , metal-pl via , conduct wire line , etc . ) embed in insul materi . the batteri is form dure beol integr within one or more wire level , and the conduct metal conduct coupl posit and neg termin of the batteri to the electron devic . the batteri may have sever differ topolog rel to the structur and geometr relationship among the batteri electrod and electrolyt . multipl batteri may be form within one or more wire level , and may be conduct coupl to the electron devic . the multipl batteri may be connect in seri or in parallel .
