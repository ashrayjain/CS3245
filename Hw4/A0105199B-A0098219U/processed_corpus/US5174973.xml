method and apparatu for effect gas-liquid contact compon , usual but not exclus gaseou compon , are remov in a liquid medium from ga stream and chemic convert into an insolubl phase or physic remov . specif , hydrogen sulfid may be remov from stream by oxid in aqueou chelat transit metal solut in a modifi agit flotat cell . a gas-liquid contact apparatu , gener a combin chemic reactor and solid product separ devic , compris such modifi agit flotat cell also is describ . in order to effect effici mass transfer and rapid reaction , ga bubbl contain hydrogen sulfid and oxygen are form by rotat an impel at a blade tip veloc of at least about 350 in/sec . to achiev the requir shear . to assist in the reaction , a surround shroud ha a plural of open , gener of aspect ratio of approxim 1 , of equal diamet and arrang in uniform pattern , such as to provid a ga flow therethrough less than about 0.02 lb/min/open in the shroud . in gener , the ga veloc index is at least about 18 per second per open , prefer at least about 24 per second per open . each of the open ha an area correspond to an equival diamet less than about one inch .
