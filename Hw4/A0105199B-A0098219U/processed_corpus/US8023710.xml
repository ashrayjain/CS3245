virtual colonoscopi via wavelet variou techniqu can be use to improv classif of colon polyp candid found via comput tomograph colonographi comput aid detect ( ctccad ) . a polyp candid can be classifi as a true posit or a fals posit . for exampl , a two-dimension project imag of the polyp can be gener from a three-dimension represent and classifi base on featur of the project imag . an optim viewpoint for the project imag can be found via techniqu such as maxim viewpoint entropi . wavelet process can be use to extract featur from the two-dimension project imag . featur extract can use a piecewis linear orthonorm float search for locat most predict neighbor for wavelet coeffici , and support vector machin can be employ for classif . the techniqu can be use for improv accuraci of ctccad techniqu .
