use a model tree of group token to identifi an object in an imag object recognit techniqu are disclos that provid both accuraci and speed . one embodi of the present invent is an identif system . the system is capabl of locat object in imag by search for local featur of an object . the system can oper in real-tim . the system is train from a set of imag of an object or object . the system comput interest point in the train imag , and then extract local imag featur ( token ) around these interest point . the set of token from the train imag is then use to build a hierarch model structur . dure identification/detect , the system comput interest point from incom target imag . the system match token around these interest point with the token in the hierarch model . each success match imag token vote for an object hypothesi at a certain scale , locat , and orient in the target imag . object hypothes that receiv insuffici vote are reject .
