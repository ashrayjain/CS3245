method of remov phosphoru and/or nitrogen the present invent provid a method of treat wastewat contain phosphoru and/or nitrogen for remov phosphoru and/or nitrogen from the wastewat , includ follow step of : ( a ) introduc wastewat contain phosphoru and/or nitrogen into a an anaerob reactor , treat the introduc wastewat with anaerob microorgan , to produc bioga from organ matter in the wastewat , and then discharg the treat wastewat satur with carbon dioxid under carbon dioxid partial pressur of 0.2 to 0.5 atm ; and ( b ) inject the treat wastewat of step ( a ) into a carbon dioxid strip apparatu wherein the wastewat is free-fallen to expos the wastewat to ambient condit with carbon dioxid partial pressur of less than 0.001 atm so that carbon dioxid strip take place and increas in ph occur without addit of alkalin substanc , and then provid proper ph of 8.4 to 9.6 to form struvit .
