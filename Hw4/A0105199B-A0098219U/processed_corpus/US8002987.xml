stationari phase and column use cucurbituril bond silica gel , and separ method of taxol use the column provid are a stationari phase and a column use a cucurbituril-bound silica gel , and a method of separ taxan use the column . the taxan separ method includ : prepar a column for taxan separ , the column be pack with a stationari phase includ a cucurbituril-bound silica gel in which a cucurbituril repres by formula 1 or 2 is coval bound to a modifi silica gel repres by formula 3 ; dissolv a taxan powder in a solvent to prepar a taxane-contain solut ; appli the taxane-contain solut to the column ; suppli a mobile-phas solvent to the column to obtain a taxan extract from the column ; and purifi taxan from the taxan extract . therefor , highli purifi taxan can be separ from a low-pur crude taxan extract .
