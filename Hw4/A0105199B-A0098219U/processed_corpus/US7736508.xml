system and method for biolog wastewat treatment and for use the byproduct thereof a wastewat treatment system and process biolog treat wastewat to produc substanti clean water effluent and byproduct . the treatment system includ an array of media wheel that rotat into and out of exposur to sunlight for sustain alga growth . one byproduct is alga remov from the rotat media wheel , which may be provid to other process facil to produc , for instanc , bio-diesel fuel . wast co.sub.2 from the process facil may also be return to the treatment system for enhanc alga growth . bacteria is provid to form a symbiot relationship with the alga , fuel by sunlight to effect remov toxic materi from the wastewat . larg scale facil may integr the treatment system in a regen cycl in which the biomass obtain from the algal coloni is use in a separ facil and byproduct of the oper of the separ facil are use by the treatment system to fuel further algal growth .
