water decontamin apparatu and method a process and apparatu for water purif ha a stationari electrod oppos a movabl electrod which are posit about a passageway for the water to be purifi . the stationari electrod and movabl electrod form an arc gap , and the arc gap is fed with a voltag from a pulsatil power suppli . the arc gap is reduc when the current is below a first threshold and increas when the current is abov a second threshold , and the arc gap chang is realiz by control a motor attach to feeder roller coupl to the movabl electrod . the apparatu caus the format of oxid nano-particl provid durabl bactericid action .
