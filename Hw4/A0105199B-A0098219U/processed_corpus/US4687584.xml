sludg remov and processor a sludg remov and processor includ a first vessel hold clean liquid and a second , phase separ vessel . clean liquid from the first vessel is spray against a dirti surfac . a vacuum pump keep the second vessel upper region at a partial vacuum so clean liquid and dislodg matter from the dirti surfac is suck into the second vessel . solid and liquid are pump from the second vessel into a solid separ where the larger solid are remov for dispos and liquid is pump into a centrifug which remov fine solid particl . the fine particl are mix with a bulk solidif medium for dispos . oil collect in the vessel is enhanc by the partial vacuum which lower the boil point so tini bubbl are form to aid separ of the oili and non-oili phase . pass the liquid through a centrifug also aid separ of the oili and non-oili phase in the first vessel .
