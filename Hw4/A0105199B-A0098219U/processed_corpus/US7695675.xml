method of inactiv microorgan in a fluid use ultraviolet radiat a method of inactiv microorgan such as virus within a fluid such as a biolog fluid is disclos . the method includ the step of provid a uv reactor , which may take the form of an elong gener annular reaction chamber surround at least one elong uv lamp , move the fluid within the reaction chamber in a primari flow direct along the length of the uv lamp , and induc a circul secondari flow within the fluid with the secondari flow be superimpos on the primari flow . as the fluid move through the reaction chamber in the primari flow , it is circul repeatedli toward and away from the uv lamp in the circul secondari flow to provid uniform and control exposur of the entir volum of fluid to ultraviolet radiat . microorgan such as virus are thu inactiv while desir compon in the fluid , such as protein , are preserv without the use of a free radic scaveng .
