saccharid composit purif instrument the present invent provid a sugar chain purif instrument which can continu and effici purifi the sugar chain . accord to the present invent , the instrument includ an immobil proteas column in which a carrier which can be pack in the column and on which proteas is immobil is pack and an immobil glycopeptidas column in which a carrier which can be pack in the column and on which glycopeptidas is immobil is pack , these column be connect in seri , and the reaction is carri out while continu pass a glycoprotein to be decompos togeth with a suitabl buffer solut through the abov column . the step of liber of sugar chain from the glycoprotein is highli simplifi and labor-sav , and liber of the sugar chain can be moder and simpli perform .
