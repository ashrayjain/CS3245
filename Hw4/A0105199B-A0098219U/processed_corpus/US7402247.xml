system for wastewat treatment and digest have aerob and anaerob treatment zone the specif disclos a method for treat and digest organ wast in a wastewat stream . a first wastewat influent stream is mix with an activ sludg biomass in an aerob digest zone , so that least a portion of the organ wast in the first wastewat influent stream are digest by activ sludg biomass . the first wastewat influent stream is separ from the activ sludg biomass in a first separ zone to recov activ sludg biomass and to provid a wastewat effluent stream . the second wastewat influent stream is mix with recov activ sludg biomass from the aerob digest zone in a substanti anaerob adsorpt zone so that at least a portion of the organ wast in the second wastewat influent stream are adsorb by the activ sludg biomass . the second wastewat influent stream and the activ sludg biomass are then separ in a second separ zone to recov the activ sludg biomass and organ wast adsorb thereto from the anaerob adsorpt zone and to provid a substanti liquid wastewat stream which is recycl to the aerob digest zone . final , at least a portion of the activ sludg biomass and adsorb organ wast from the anaerob adsorpt zone are digest under substanti anaerob condit so as to recov a combust ga stream . an apparatu for carri out the method is also disclos .
