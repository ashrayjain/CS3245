support catalyst system the present invent relat to a support catalyst system . the support catalyst of the present invent compris an inorgan support have attach to at least one surfac thereof non-acid , hydrophil , hydroxyl-contain organ r.sub.10 group have no or substanti no surfac charg in solut , and at least one linker capabl of bind a catalyt speci , e.g . an enzym or an organometal molecul , wherein the linker is attach to a catalyt speci . the r.sub.10 group prefer are select from the group consist of -- ch.sub.2oh , -- ch ( oh ) .sub.2 , -- ch ( oh ) ch.sub.3 , -- ch.sub.2ch.sub.2oh , -- ch ( oh ) .sub.2ch.sub.3 , -- ch.sub.2ch ( oh ) .sub.2 , -- ch ( oh ) ch.sub.2 ( oh ) and mixtur thereof . the presenc of the r.sub.10 group on the support surfac prevent or reduc non-specif bind of the catalyt speci with the support surfac by minim hydrophob interact and provid no or substanti no surfac charg in the region of the support have catalyt speci attach thereto . simultan , the linker bind the catalyt speci to the surfac of the support in a manner which permit the catalyt speci to be freeli avail for catalyt activ . method of catalyz a reaction use the support catalyst system of the invent are also disclos .
