treatment of fluid with wave energi from a carbon arc a method and apparatu for treat a fluid use a wave energi use a gas-sparg pipe configur to creat a flow of the fluid in a thin film along a vortex path from a first end to a second end of the gas-sparg pipe , a first electrod and a second electrod that are at least partial dispos within the gas-sparg pipe , space apart from one anoth , and axial align with one anoth along a central axi of the gas-sparg pipe from the first end to the second end . the electrod are use to creat an open electr arc to provid the wave energi directli expos the fluid as the fluid flow along the vortex path in close proxim to and surround the electr arc such that onli a ga separ the fluid from the open electr arc .
