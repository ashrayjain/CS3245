passiv drain field system for wastewat treatment and associ method a passiv drain field assembl reduc nitrogen in wastewat by facilit nitrif and denitrif . a first chamber receiv effluent into a multi-pip bundl . an air vent is provid that extend from the atmospher into the first chamber . a second chamber receiv effluent from the first chamber , and contain a medium , beneath which is posit a drainag pipe for releas treat effluent into the soil therebeneath . a berm creat a retent area in the second chamber that is line with a water-imperm liner . in use , ammonia present in the effluent is convert to nitrat in the presenc of the oxygen admit by the air vent in the first chamber . the liquid retain upstream of the berm and abov the liner undergo anaerob reaction . the remain liquid proce to a place in the second chamber from which the drainag pipe can be enter , from which the treat wastewat can enter the soil .
