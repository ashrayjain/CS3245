mediat electrochem oxid of organ wast materi a mediat electrochem oxid process is use to treat and destroy organ wast materi . the materi are introduc into an apparatu contain an electrolyt have the oxid form of one or more redox coupl . the oxid coupl oxid the organ wast materi and are convert into their reduc form . the reduc form are reoxid by electrochem anod oxid in the anod compart of an electrochem cell or reaction with the oxid form of other redox coupl . the redox cycl continu until the desir degre of oxid is reach . the process take place at temperatur between ambient and approxim 100.degre . c. , to avoid the format of dioxin or furan . the oxid process may be enhanc by the addit of reaction enhanc , such as : ultrason energi and/or ultraviolet radiat .
