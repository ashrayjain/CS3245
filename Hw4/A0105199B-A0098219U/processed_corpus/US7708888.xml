apparatu for withdraw permeat use an immers vertic skein of hollow fibr membran a filtrat devic is provid for withdraw permeat essenti continu from a multicompon aqueou substrat contain grow microorgan in a reservoir . a vertic skein of fiber is scrub with coars bubbl which eman from a convers baffl posit under the skein . the substrat is aerat with fine bubbl in a size rang small enough to transfer oxygen to the substrat effici . the baffl trap the fine bubbl and convert them to coars bubbl which are effect to scrub the fiber . in the most prefer embodi , the finish header of the skein are deriv from composit header compris a fix lamina of resin in which the fiber are pot near their termin end , and a fugit lamina of fugit powderi materi in which the termin end of the fiber are pot . the fugit lamina is remov , prefer by dissolv the powder , e.g . fine divid common salt in water .
