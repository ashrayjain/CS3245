batteri case in a batteri case mount on electron equip , the thick of the batteri case is reduc as obtain the hold forc of batteri with respect to vibrat and impact by use of a case main bodi with a simpl structur and a case cover . a depth of a batteri contain portion of the case main bodi 1 is structur such that a side face of each batteri is protrud outwardli than an end face of a frame portion in a state that the batteri 2 are contain . on the other hand , the case cover 10 is form of plate materi cover the side face of each of the respect contain batteri 2 , and plate-lik magnet 14 and 15 are adher onto face opposit to the respect batteri 2 . the case cover 10 is attach to the respect dri batteri by an absorb forc of the plate-lik magnet 14 and 15 to share a hold forc between the dri batteri , therebi prevent the dri batteri from be detach even if vibrat and impact act . sinc there is no need to provid an attach mechan for the case cover 10 to the case main bodi 1 , a reduct in the batteri case can be improv .
