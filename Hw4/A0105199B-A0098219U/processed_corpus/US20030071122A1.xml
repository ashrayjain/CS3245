internet-bas method of and system for remot monitor , configur and servic planar laser illumin and imag ( pliim ) base network with node for support object identif and attribut inform acquisit function method of and system for illumin object use planar laser illumin beam have substantially-planar spatial distribut characterist that extend through the field of view ( fov ) of imag format and detect modul employ in such system . each planar laser illumin beam is produc from a planar laser illumin beam array ( plia ) compris an plural of planar laser illumin modul ( plim ) . each plim compris a visibl laser diod ( vld , a focus len , and a cylindr optic element arrang therewith . the individu planar laser illumin beam compon produc from each plim are optic combin to produc a composit substanti planar laser illumin beam have substanti uniform power densiti characterist over the entir spatial extend thereof and thu the work rang of the system . prefer , each planar laser illumin beam compon is focus so that the minimum beam width thereof occur at a point or plane which is the farthest or maximum object distanc at which the system is design to acquir imag , therebi compens for decreas in the power densiti of the incid planar laser illumin beam due to the fact that the width of the planar laser illumin beam increas in length for increas object distanc away from the imag optic . by virtu of the present invent , it is now possibl to use both vld and high-spe ccd-type imag detector in conveyor , hand-held and hold-und type scan applic alik , enjoy the advantag and benefit that each such technolog ha to offer , while avoid the shortcom and drawback hitherto associ therewith .
