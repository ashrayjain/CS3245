implant have mem flow modul with movabl , flow-control baffl variou embodi of mem flow modul that may be dispos in a flow path ( 296 ) of a shunt ( 290 ) are disclos , where the shunt ( 290 ) may be use to control a flow out of an anterior chamber ( 284 ) of an eye ( 266 ) . one such mem flow modul ( 58 ) ha a tune element ( 78 ) and a lower plate ( 70 ) . a plural of spring or spring-lik structur ( 82 ) interconnect the tune element ( 78 ) with the lower plate ( 70 ) in a manner that allow the tune element ( 78 ) to move either toward or away from the lower plate ( 70 ) , depend upon the pressur be exert on the tune element ( 78 ) by a flow through a lower flow port ( 74 ) on the lower plate ( 70 ) . the tune element ( 78 ) is dispos over thi lower flow port ( 74 ) to induc a flow through the mem flow modul ( 58 ) along a non-linear ( geometr ) flow path .
