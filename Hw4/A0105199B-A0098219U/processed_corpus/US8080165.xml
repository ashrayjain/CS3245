system and method for disinfect method and system for establish taylor-couett flow in a fluid are provid . aspect of the disclos method and system incorpor laminar taylor-couett flow in combin with a sourc of radiat to provid more uniform radiat exposur to the fluid and it compon . common problem of non-uniform radiat level and concentr boundari layer effect in uv reactor are larg elimin use the method and devic provid herein . in an exemplari embodi , the reactor of the present disclosur ha a hollow outer cylind or stator and a rotor posit therein and smooth wall for both the outer wall of it rotor and the inner wall of the outer cylind or stator in which the rotor is posit , the space between which form the annular fluid gap .
