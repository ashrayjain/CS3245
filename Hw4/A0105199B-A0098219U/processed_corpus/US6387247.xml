feed inject system for catalyt crack process a catalyt cracker riser reactor is connect to a regener standpip through which hot , regener catalyst enter the riser bottom region . a hydrocarbon feed , such as ga oil , and dispers gase , such as steam , are introduc through a singl bottom entri nozzl assembl . the nozzl assembl compris three concentr arrang conduit . an inner conduit provid a passageway for a first dispers ga and termin in a first cap have at least one outlet passag for discharg the first dispers ga in a gener radial outward and upward direct . the first conduit and first cap are enclos by a second conduit and second cap , the annulu form therebi provid a passageway for a liquid hydrocarbon feed . the second cap also ha at least one outlet passag for discharg the mixtur of hydrocarbon feed and first dispers ga into the riser reactor in a radial outward and upward direct . a first dispers ga enter the inner conduit and proce to the first cap into a mix zone locat in the vicin of the discharg passag between the first and second cap . hydrocarbon feed enter the second conduit , continu through an annulu to the second cap and is mix with the first dispers ga in the mix zone , result in the format of a fine two-phas mixtur of small dispers bubbl in heavi petroleum hydrocarbon liquid . as the fine two-phas mixtur pass through the outlet passag into the riser reactor to contact with regener catalyst , the two-phas mixtur suddenli expand , form a fine atom of heavi petroleum hydrocarbon feed with narrow droplet size evenli distribut across the riser reactor .
