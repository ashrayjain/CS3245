reactor and method for anaerob wastewat treatment a reactor ( 10 ) for anaerob wast water treatment is design as a loop-typ column reactor compris a central flow channel ( 20 ) . in the annular space ( 40 ) between the central flow channel ( 20 ) and the reactor wall , there are posit carrier element ( 50 ) for immobil microorgan , with flow passag be provid between adjac carrier element ( 50 ) . the lower portion of the reactor ( 30 ) , below the carrier element , is design as a space intend to receiv wast water have microorgan float therein dure oper of the reactor ( 10 ) . dure oper , there are provid both float microorgan and microorgan that are immobil on the carrier element . the wast water to be treat flow central downward and up again along the carrier element ( 40 ) , with the flow be gener in part by the ga develop of the microorgan . the reactor is use to carri out a process for anaerob wast water treatment , the reactor be suit for wast water treatment in the food process industri and the feed stuff industri as well as in the paper industri and the textil industri .
