multi-dr portabl comput have a plural of heat sink member therein a notebook comput base hous ha oper dispos therein a cd rom drive , a hard disk drive and a floppi disk drive , an ac/dc electr power convert , a modem , a pcmcia card bay structur and a batteri . thi intern provis of three drive unit in addit to the other equip within the base hous is facilit from a space standpoint by the vertic stack of the hard disk drive atop the cd rom drive within the base hous . to dissip the oper heat from these compon within the base hous , a heat spreader plate is interpos between the cd rom drive and the overli hard disk drive , and the high heat-gener compon -- name , the modem , the ac/dc convert , the pcmcia card bay structur , and the comput processor -- are close group togeth , with the ac/dc convert in thermal commun with a second heat spreader plate . the processor is dispos abov the other high heat-gener compon on a horizont orient main system circuit board with the circuit board have top and bottom side heat sink member thermal commun with the processor . an axial fan dispos in the base hous creat an upper flow of cool air that pass over the upper heat sink member , and a lower flow of-cool air that pass over the lower heat sink member and the heat-gener compon group below the processor .
