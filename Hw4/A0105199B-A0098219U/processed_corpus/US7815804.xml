method for treat wastewat or produc water a method or process for treat wastewat contain high organ , silica , boron , hard , and suspend and dissolv solid . the method includ degasifi the wastewat for the remov of dissolv gase and thereaft chemic soften the wastewat . after the chemic soften step , the wastewat is direct through a media filter or membran which remov addit solid and precipit . thereaft the wastewat is direct through a sodium ion exchang that further soften the wastewat . the effluent from the ion exchang is direct through a cartridg filter and the effluent from the cartridg filter is direct through one or more revers osmosi unit . at a select phase of the process , prior to the wastewat reach the revers osmosi unit or unit , the ph of the wastewat is rais and maintain such that the ph of the wastewat reach a revers osmosi unit is at a ph greater than 10.5 .
