bioreactor for select control the molecular diffus between fluid a diffus control bioreactor that select control the molecular diffus between fluid through a microchannel in fluid commun with a reaction reservoir . the length and cross-sect area are select to obtain a predetermin rate of molecular diffus between fluid . when the fluid are liquid , flow through the microchannel is laminar and the capillari action of the microchannel and fluid is such that the fluid doe not flow into the reaction reservoir unless the pressur of the fluid is increas by an extern sourc , therebi minim contamin of the bioreactor . the instant invent may also util at least one microchannel and reagent reservoir to regul , rather than prevent , the passag of variou molecul into the bioreactor . a pressur equal vent oper on similar principl to the microchannel may have a structur configur to minim the chanc of fluid leakag from the bioreactor , even if the bioreactor is turn in variou direct .
