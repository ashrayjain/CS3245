structur that inhibit microbi growth structur treat with a microbiolog intercept enhanc agent compris of a water-solubl cation materi have a counter ion associ therewith at specif site on the cation materi , in combin with a biolog activ metal salt , wherein the counter ion associ with the cation materi preferenti precipit with at least a portion of the cation of the biolog activ metal salt such that precipit of the biolog activ metal cation and the counter ion associ with the cation materi occur in proxim to the cation materi are disclos herein . the microbiolog intercept enhanc agent may be incorpor into articl of commerc by treat the start materi of the structur or by appli the microbiolog intercept enhanc agent on to at least one surfac of the articl .
