reactor for remov chemic and biolog contamin from a contamin fluid a reactor apparatu and method for remov chemic and biolog contamin from a contamin fluid while minim disinfect by-product , sludg , and harm residu . the reactor ha a sequenti , multi-stag , reaction vessel with an upper end region and a lower end region . the vessel ha a liquid inlet port into which the contamin fluid may pass . treat liquid may exit the reactor through a liquid outlet port . a ga inlet port and a ga outlet port are provid . a plural of stack reaction chamber have a siev tray and flang assembl , the siev tray have hole up through which a gaseou phase may pass . a ga phase electrod , an electr power suppli capabl of produc puls electr discharg connect thereto , and a liquid phase electrod are provid . the electrod creat therebetween a puls corona discharg for gener reactiv speci in situ and destroy bacteri contamin in the liquid . a weir-downcom tube ha an upper portion situat abov a level of liquid in the associ chamber . the lower portion is situat below a level of liquid in a reaction chamber next below . the weir-downcom tube minim or prevent back flow of liquid from a reaction chamber to an upstream reaction chamber .
