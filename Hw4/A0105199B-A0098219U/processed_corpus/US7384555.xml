process for biolog treatment of aqueou organ wast a process and an apparatu for an aerob biolog treatment of aqueou organ wast , in which the aqueou organ wast is suppli to an aerat tank for an aerob biolog treatment in the presenc of a biosludg compos essenti of aerob microorgan . the aerat aqueou suspens in the aerat tank is subject to solid/liquid , separ , the so-separ liquid phase is remov as treat water , at least a portion of the separ sludg is recycl to the aerat tank , a part of the aqueou suspens in the aerat tank or of the separ sludg is treat with ozon at a ph of 5 or lower , and the ozon suspens or sludg is recycl to the step of aerob biolog treatment . the biosludg is transform into bod compon use a decreas amount of ozon to therebi decreas the amount of excess sludg and , in some case , even reduc it to zero .
