method and devic for prevent corros in hot water system undergo intermitt oper disclos is a method of control a real-tim oxidation-reduct potenti in a hot water system undergo a wet layup sequenc to inhibit corros in the hot water system . the method includ separ the wet layup sequenc into a plural of phase . each phase is either short-term or long-term and a subset of the short-term phase is option transit . the method further includ defin one or more zone in the hot water system . at least one of the defin zone is select for each phase and one or more of the select zone includ at least one orp probe oper to measur the real-tim orp and commun with a control . the orp probe ( s ) either intermitt or continu measur the real-tim orp at oper temperatur and pressur at one or more of the select zone in one or more of the phase and transmit the measur real-tim orp to the control . the real-tim orp is assess to determin whether it conform to an orp set for that phase . the invent further includ a multi-compon control devic for a hot water system undergo a wet layup sequenc .
