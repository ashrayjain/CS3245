dissimilatori sulfat reduct as a process to promot denitrif in marin recircul aquacultur system the present invent relat to a novel approach for nitrat remov from a marin recircul system ( 10 ) wherein high concentr of sulfat found in seawat is use in combin with sludg ( 20 ) collect from fish grow tank ( 12 ) to promot dissimilatori sulfat reduct to hydrogen sulfid . the sulfid is use as an electron sourc to promot autotroph denitrif in an up-flow fix bed bioreactor ( 16 ) , follow by nitrif in a nitrif unit ( 14 ) . by util the symbiot relationship between the sulfate-reduc and sulfide-oxid bacteri commun , nitrat accumul is control in the recircul water of the system therebi reduc water exchang in the marin recircul system .
