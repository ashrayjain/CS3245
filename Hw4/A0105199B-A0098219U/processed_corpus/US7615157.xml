apparatu for withdraw permeat use an immers vertic skein of hollow fibr membran a process is describ for withdraw filter permeat from a non-pressur substrat in a reservoir through an assembl . the assembl ha a plural of hollow fiber filter membran dispos gener vertic between two solid bodi , an enclosur seal to the upper solid bodi to defin a caviti , a permeat port in commun with the caviti and the lumen of each membran in fluid commun with the port via the caviti . a suction is appli to lumen of the membran via the permeat port to withdraw permeat . a ga is direct to provid bubbl which contact the membran . feed water is ad so that the membran are immers while appli the suction .
