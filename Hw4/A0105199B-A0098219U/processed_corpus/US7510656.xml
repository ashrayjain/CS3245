wast water treatment method system and method have been develop for reclaim water contamin with the expect rang of contamin typic associ with produc water , includ water contamin with slick water , methanol and boron . the system includ anaerob digest the contamin water , follow by aerat the water to enhanc biolog digest . after aerat , the water is separ use a flotat oper that effect remov the spent friction reduc agent and allow the treat water to be reclaim and reus as fractur water , even though it retain level of contamin , includ boron and methanol , that would prevent it discharg to the environ under exist standard . the treat water may further be treat by remov the methanol via biolog digest in a bioreactor , separ a major of the contamin from the water by revers osmosi and remov the boron that pass through the revers osmosi system with a boron-remov ion exchang resin .
