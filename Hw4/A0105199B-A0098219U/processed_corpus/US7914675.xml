anaerob purif of heat wast water the invent is direct to a process for the anaerob purif of wast water in an anaerob reactor , said process compris burn the bioga produc in the purif , in a gas-burn , use the hot gase obtain therebi for indirect heat of water in a hot water boiler , which boiler is connect with the reactor by mean of a line between the ga head of the boiler and a compart through which the wast water flow , such as a condit tank or the anaerob reactor , which line end underneath the water level in the said compart at such a level that a pressur of between 0.25 and 3 m of water column is maintain in the ga head of the boiler , in which boiler steam is gener which enter the said compart through the said line and heat the wast water , and wherein the said boiler is further provid with a valv to let off steam in case the amount of bioga is in excess of the amount need to heat the wast water .
