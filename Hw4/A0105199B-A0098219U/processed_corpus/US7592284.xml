prepar of ion exchang polym bound nitrogen adsorb a high capac adsorb may be use for enrich oxygen concentr in an air stream . such a high capac adsorb may be from about 2 to about 3 time lighter rel to the current avail technolog . furthermor , the high capac adsorb is readili capabl of regener after deactiv by water vapor . unlik current avail immobil technolog in which clay binder wa use to bind 13x zeolit and addit 10 % organ binder wa use to immobil bead , the adsorb of the present invent may be made use just an organ binder , therebi reduc pore spoilag caus by the clay binder . further unlik convent adsorb , which may use sodium as it cation , the adsorb of the present invent use a lithium cation , therebi result in enhanc nitrogen adsorpt perform .
