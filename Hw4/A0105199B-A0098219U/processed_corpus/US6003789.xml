nozzl for atom liquid in two phase flow mix mean , for produc a flow mixtur of oil and steam , is combin with an atom nozzl to provid a nozzl assembl which produc a jet of veri fine oil droplet . the nozzl assembl is use in conjunct with a reactor , such as a fluidiz bed coker . the mix mean compris a pipe , extern of the reactor , have separ , space apart inlet for oil and steam . the steam inlet is upstream of the oil inlet . a reduc diamet nozzl is posit in the pipe bore between the inlet , for acceler the steam . the steam contact the oil and turbul move down the pipe bore to produc what is known as a `` bubbl flow '' mixtur . the mixtur is fed to the nozzl , which is intern of the reactor . the nozzl ha : an inlet ; a first contract section of reduc diamet for acceler the flow , prefer to superson veloc , wherebi the droplet are reduc in size ; a diffus section of expand diamet wherein the mixtur deceler and a shock wave may be induc ; a second contract section oper to acceler the mixtur more than the first contract section ; and an orific outlet for produc a jet or spray . the nozzl assembl ha been shown to reduc droplet size from about 12,000 .mu.m to about 300 .mu.m .
