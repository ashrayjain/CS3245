electron pocket dosimet small , light-weight portabl radiat measur apparatu provid accur quantit measur of radiat dosag and dosag rate . such apparatu , refer to as a dosimet , is hous in a rugged hous that is onli about 1/2 the volum of a packag of cigarett , may easili be clip to cloth or carri in a shirt pocket , and is power by a convent alkalin aa-siz batteri . includ in the hous are a geiger tube for detect radiat , a high voltag power suppli for provid power to the geiger tube , a count circuit for count geiger puls gener by the geiger tube , a microprocessor circuit for process the geiger puls in accord with a prescrib program to determin the doe or dosag rate to which the geiger tube ha been expos , and a digit display that display the dosag rate thu determin . the microprocessor program is store in memori circuit , includ as part of the microprocessor circuit . an audibl alarm is gener whenev the dose or dosag rate exce a programm threshold . the circuitri and display allow a wide rang of radiat level to be detect and display . all the circuit are design for low power consumpt , allow 500-600 hour of continu use befor have to replac the batteri . a dielectr coupl commun port allow necessari data , e.g. , calibr coeffici or dosag data , to be transfer to and from the dosimet circuitri without direct physic contact .
