identif of anatom featur from data a nuclear medicin imag is scan and pixel of maximum and minimum intens are identifi and correl with each other use constraint which are empir determin to relat to the featur of interest ( such as the heart ) . the inform thu obtain is use to defin a region of interest in which an anatom featur of interest may be locat , and to posit a scintil camera detector to carri out a nuclear medicin studi at optim posit . to properli posit a subject patient , anatom landmark relat to a target organ are automat identifi by a comput . the landmark are superimpos upon a nuclear medicin persist imag of the target organ . thi facilit technician identif of the target organ and also facilit repeat of , e.g. , myocardi perfus studi , which requir that two studi be perform on a singl patient at two differ time . to determin the depth of the target organ , two planar nuclear medicin imag of a target organ are acquir use a focuss collim at two differ height . an anatom landmark associ with the target organ is computer-identifi in each of the imag , and the depth of the target organ is determin geometr use the differ in size between the imag of the identifi landmark and the differ in height .
