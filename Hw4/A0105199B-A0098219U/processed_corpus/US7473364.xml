multival metal ion manag for low sludg process a method for manag multival metal ion concentr in low-yield wastewat treatment process . the method includ combin wastewat contain bod with bacteria-laden sludg in a mainstream reactor to form a mix liquor , separ the mix liquor into a clear effluent and an activ sludg stream , return a first portion of the activ sludg stream to the mainstream reactor , process a second portion of the activ sludg stream in a sidestream bioreactor , return at least a portion of the activ sludg stream in the sidestream bioreactor to the mainstream reactor , and ad multival metal ion to at least one of the wastewat , the mix liquor , the activ sludg stream and combin thereof to reduc the gener of wast activ sludg .
