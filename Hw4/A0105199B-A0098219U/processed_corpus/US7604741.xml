method for on-sit product of nitrat ion an apparatu and method produc nitrat ion on-sit from water , natur ga and air extract in proxim to the apparatu . the apparatu gener nitrat ion and bring the nitrat ion into contact with an aqueou system . hydrogen sulfid present in the aqueou system is remov and the product of hydrogen sulfid by sulfate-reduc bacteria ( srb ) is elimin by introduc into the system nitrat ion , wherebi denitrifi microorgan , use nitrat , outcompet the sulfate-reduc bacteria for the avail carbon nutrient , thu prevent the srb from produc hydrogen sulfid . nitrat ion gener by the apparatu and ad to the aqueou system which contain the denitrifi microorgan can enhanc oil recoveri by mean of microbi enhanc oil recoveri mechan .
