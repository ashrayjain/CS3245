method for use biomass in bioga process the invent relat to a method for use biomass in a bioga process . the aim of the invent is to use substrat have a high nitrogen and solid content , and which use a small amount of water , ha veri good energi balanc and is particularli environment friendli . said aim is achiev by the virtu of the fact that the substrat is treat with a recircul product in order to form a pumpabl medium , and addit treat with bacteria in cyclon and ferment , which simultan remov the nitrogen in a strip process , separ the solid ferment radic and further use the recircul product as a heat-exchang and reaction medium . said process is environment friendli and ha a veri good energi balanc .
