upflow bioreactor with septum and pressur releas mechan an upflow bioreactor includ a vessel have an inlet and an outlet configur for upflow oper . a septum is posit within the vessel and defin a lower chamber and an upper chamber . the septum includ an apertur that provid fluid commun between the upper chamber and lower chamber . the bioreactor also includ mean for releas pressur buildup in the lower chamber . in one configur , the septum includ a releas portion have an open posit and a close posit . the releas portion is configur to move to the open posit in respons to pressur buildup in the lower chamber . in the open posit fluid commun between the lower chamber and the upper chamber is increas . altern the lower chamber can includ a pressur releas line that is select actuat by pressur buildup . the pressur releas mechan can prevent the bioreactor from plug and/or prevent catastroph damag to the bioreactor caus by high pressur .
