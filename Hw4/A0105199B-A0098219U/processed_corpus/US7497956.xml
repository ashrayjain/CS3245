method for stabil and condit urban and industri wastewat sludg the invent concern a method for stabil and condit wastewat sludg . the invent is character in that it consist in treat sludg in an acid environ ( 3.0.ltoreq.ph.ltoreq.5.0 ) , with an inorgan acid and two oxid agent , that is a ferric iron salt and hydrogen peroxid . the ferric iron salt is use in such an amount as to obtain a concentr rang between 5 and 40 kg of fe per ton of dri sludg ; the hydrogen peroxid is use in such an amount as to obtain a concentr rang between 5 and 40 kg of h.sub.2o.sub.2 per ton of dri sludg ; mix the treat sludg for a time interv suffici to stabil the sludg and improv it dehydr ; then floccul the stabil sludg by ad an organ polym ; then dehydr the floccul sludg . said method enabl to significantli improv the dehydr properti of the sludg while increas the dri solid content dure it mechan dehydr .
