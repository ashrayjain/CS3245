method of util ion exchang resin and revers osmosi to reduc environment discharg and improv effluent qualiti to permit recycl of aqueou or radwast fluid method of maxim resin util and optim revers osmosi perform to polish an aqueou or radwast fluid . the method provid resin scaveng of target isotop and expos filter media and resin to a higher influent activ concentr to enabl higher wast load and longer life of resin while protect downstream revers osmosi system from high concentr of contaminants.an aqueou wast feedstream is process through step of filter , deminer , and revers osmosi ; and the feedstream is separ into permeat and reject stream for recycl and evalu , respect . the permeat stream is recycl in way that permit it to return to a suppli area for recycl reus or discharg . one of the step in the invent reduc concentr of undesir constitu in the reject stream which may advers affect wast classif for packag , ship and dispos and protect personnel from radiat exposur by reduc the overal dose rate of the process reject stream and revers osmosi system .
