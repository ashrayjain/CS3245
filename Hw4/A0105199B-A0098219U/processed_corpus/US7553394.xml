method for remov potassium from ash produc in a kraft pulp process recoveri boiler use a na-typ cation exchang organ resin in the process for produc kraft pulp , perform a potassium ion remov step of flow an aqueou solut contain ash recov from a combust exhaust ga gener in a black solut combust step by a dust collector through a pack bed fill with a sodium-typ cation exchang organ resin to adsorb and remov potassium ion contain in the aqueou solut ; and a regener step of treat the cation exchang organ resin use in the potassium ion remov step with a solut consist essenti of aqueou sodium hydroxid to regener the cation exchang resin , where a fraction recov from the potassium ion remov step which is rich in sodium sulfat and sodium carbon is recycl to the black solut concentr step , and a sodium hydroxid effluent recov from the regener step is recycl to a bleach step and use in a bleach process .
