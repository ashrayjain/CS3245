reactor and method for anox treatment of a materi in a fluid reaction medium a reactor for treat with pressur water a materi in a fluid reaction medium . it compris a bodi ( 2 ) delimit a reaction area ( 10 ) , an inlet ( 48 ) for the materi to be treat in the reaction area ( 10 ) , a point ( 46 ) for introduc an oxid into the reaction area ( 10 ) , at least one outlet for the treat materi outsid the reaction area ( 10 ) , the materi to be treat follow a path defin in the reaction area between it inlet and it outlet . the point ( 46 ) for introduc the oxid in the reaction area ( 10 ) is locat downstream from the inlet ( 48 ) for the materi and is space apart from the latter by a certain distanc so as to defin an anox area ( 20 ) compris between the inlet for the materi to be treat and the point for introduc the oxid , an area in which the fluid medium is in anoxia .
