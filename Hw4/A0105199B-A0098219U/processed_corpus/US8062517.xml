system for remov of contamin from industri stream a method and system for remov from an aqueou system which is contamin therewith : ( 1 ) mercuri present as colloid , ion and/or organ bound compound , and ( 2 ) hydrocarbon solubil , dispers , and/or emulsifi in the said system . pursuant to the invent the aqueou system to be treat ( such as `` produc water '' ) is pass success through three filtrat stage . the first filtrat stage is provid with absorpt media which effect reduction/remov of dispers organ bound mercuri speci and of the dispers and partial dissolv hydrocarbon phase , as well as of some colloid mercuri and other dissolv metal speci . the second filtrat stage util a salt modifi reticul granular filtrat media for reduction/remov of slightli dissolv hydrocarbon phase , mercuri in colloid and ionic form and other dissolv metal . the third filtrat stage is a polish stage , which serv to further reduc by electroless or voltaic reduct residu element mercuri and/or residu colloid and ionic mercuri . at thi third stage metal mercuri is incorpor into a metal matrix from which the mercuri may prefer be recov .
