batteri cover latch mechan and portabl electron devic use same a batteri cover latch mechan ( 100 ) use in portabl electron devic ( 200 ) is describ includ a cover member ( 10 ) and a latch member ( 20 ) . the cover member defin a fit caviti ( 128 ) . the cover member is fit and slidabl within the caviti . the cover member includ a deform loop structur and a latch portion ( 26 ) . the loop structur includ a resili bias portion ( 24 ) . the loop structur is deform and the bias portion is bias so that the latch member is fit within the caviti when in a latch posit . the loop structur can be further deform and the bias portion further bias so that the latch member slide within the fit caviti and the latch portion is transfer from the latch posit to a releas posit .
