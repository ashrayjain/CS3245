apparatu and process for biolog wastewat treatment a self-sustain wastewat treatment facil abat greenhous ga abat , captur co.sub.2 and produc biomass to address multipl critic environment need . the facil includ an array of rotat media wheel that creat an optimum order mix of alga for sustain growth . biomass harvest from the rotat media wheel may be provid to other process facil to produc , for instanc , bio-fuel . wast co.sub.2 from the process facil may also be return to the treatment system for enhanc alga growth . bacteria are provid to form a symbiot relationship with the alga , fuel by sunlight to effect remov toxic materi from the wastewat . the multi-funct facil may also be integr into a regen facil in which the biomass obtain from the algal and bacteri coloni is use in a separ facil and byproduct of the oper of the separ facil are use by the multi-funct facil to fuel further algal growth .
