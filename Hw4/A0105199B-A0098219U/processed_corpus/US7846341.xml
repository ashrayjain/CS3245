method of ultrason treat a continu flow of fluid the present invent relat to a method of util ultrason wave emit into a fluid to treat the fluid , matter within the fluid , and/or organ within the fluid in a varieti of manner such as , but not limit to , clean object within the fluid , steril the fluid and/or object within it , separ bond matter within the fluid , segreg matter within the fluid into discret lamina , kill organ within the fluid , inactiv organ within the fluid , extract matter from organ within the fluid , extract matter from other matter within the fluid , induc chemic reaction within the fluid , and/or convert toxic matter within the fluid into a less toxic state . the method of the present invent compris the step of flow the fluid to be treat , which may contain matter and/or organ to be treat , through an object or plural of object such as , but not limit to a pipe , empti the fluid flow through the first object into an second object or plural of second object such as , but not limit to , a tank , wherein each second object possess a cross-sect area larger than the open between the first object and second object , emit ultrason wave into the fluid that are not parallel to the primari flow of fluid through the second object as it flow through the second object , establish laminar flow in the fluid as the fluid flow through the second object , and collect the fluid in a third object or plural of third object such as , but not limit to , pipe .
