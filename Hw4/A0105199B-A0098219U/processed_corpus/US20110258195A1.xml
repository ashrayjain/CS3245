system and method for automat reduc data search space and improv data extract accuraci use known constraint in a layout of extract data element a method of automat narrow data search space and improv accuraci of data extract use known constraint in a layout of extract data element for classifi document is provid . the method includ : analyz each document to classifi it within a document categori , each categori have a correspond set of expect layout ; analyz each electron document to automat extract imag and text featur ; automat construct a data structur includ a layout of the extract featur and layout relationship amongst the extract featur , wherein each of the extract featur in the layout maintain a refer to neighbor featur and wherein close relat featur are merg to form a combin featur ; automat narrow data search space by detect and remov part of the layout that are not associ with ani data element use the data structur ; and automat detect data use the extract featur layout and the layout relationship amongst the extract featur .
