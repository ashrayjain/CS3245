in line wetland water treatment system a complet storm water manag system and process which perform both drainag and treatment task and incorpor a wetland water treatment system . thi system creat an infrastructur , flow control which is multi-level and multi-stag . thi system incorpor a self-contain wetland treatment system . thi is a modular system which includ three or more linear chamber through which the storm water or other influent pass and is clean . the influent which flow into a storm drain , curb inlet , or inflow pipe into the system is direct first into a screen type catch basin inset filter within the first chamber of the system . the wetland chamber is compos of one or more modular segment which may be made in variou depth , length and width . the influent is treat within the first chamber befor it pass out of thi chamber into the incorpor wetland system . the water flow through the wetland chamber where it is further filter and decontamin through both an aerob and anaerob process . in situat of high runoff there is a bypass compon which run directli from the first chamber and bypass the wetland chamber dump the pretreat water into the discharg final chamber . thi system is fit with a variabl level treatment compon design in such a way to offer variabl discharg rate and thu vari the level of treatment over a wide rang of flow rate . the system can be place underground , and below concret , such as in park lot or park area .
