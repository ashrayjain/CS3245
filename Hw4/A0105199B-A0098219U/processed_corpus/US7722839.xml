apparatu and method for thaw biolog materi an apparatu and method are provid to rapidli thaw and heat frozen bag of biolog materi , such as plasma . the apparatu ha a hollow bladder have a flexibl wall that is place in contact with the bag . a circul system draw fluid from a reservoir and fill the bladder with the fluid . the circul system also drain fluid from the bladder . a heater in the reservoir heat the fluid befor the fluid enter the bladder . as heat fluid flow through the bladder , heat is transfer through the bladder wall to the plasma bag to thaw the biolog materi . the bladder wall expand against the plasma bag as the bladder fill with fluid , and contract from the plasma bag as the bladder is drain . the expans and contract of the bladder wall agit the plasma bag and biolog materi to acceler the thaw process .
