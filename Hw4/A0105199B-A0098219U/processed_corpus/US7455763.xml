recycl process for demet of hydrocarbon oil a recycl process for the demet of hydrocarbon oil compris recycl the follow step : a demet composit for hydrocarbon oil or an aqueou solut thereof is suffici mix with hydrocarbon oil in a desir proport , and the result mixtur is subject to a convent electr desalt process to obtain a demet hydrocarbon oil and an aqueou desalt solut contain the desalt metal salt ; the aqueou desalt solut contain the metal salt is then suffici mix with a precipit agent in a desir proport and is subject to a displac reaction , and an aqueou solut contain the demet composit is recov by separ out the residu of the metal salt produc in the displac reaction , which is poorli solubl or insolubl in water , with a solid-liquid separ ; andth recov aqueou solut contain the demet composit for hydrocarbon oil , which meet the requir for metal ion in demet hydrocarbon oil , is then mix with hydrocarbon oil in a desir proport for a next cycle.th present invent ha the follow advantag such as high effici of demet , reduct of pollut to the environ and the product cost as well as the metal salt product obtain by treat and collect the desalt residu of the metal salt .
