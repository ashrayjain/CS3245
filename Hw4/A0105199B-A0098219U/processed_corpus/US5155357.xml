portabl mass spectromet a portabl mass spectromet system . the system includ a sampl inlet for receiv a sampl of analyt molecul and an ion sourc for produc sampl ion by ioniz of the sampl molecul . a cycloid mass analyz is provid and adapt to receiv the sampl ion . the mass analyz ha a mean for induc an electr field in an analysi region and a rear earth perman magnet materi for induc a static magnet field in the analysi region , orient substanti normal to the electr field . a detector is provid for detect of said sampl ion in the analysi region . a vacuum mean maintain a low pressur in the analysi region . in variou embodi , the system is hand-port and self-contain , includ a 12v recharg batteri power suppli , and a magnet that includ a rare earth perman magnet materi such as neodymium-iron and samarium-cobalt alloy .
