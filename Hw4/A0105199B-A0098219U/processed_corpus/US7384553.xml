method for oper anaerob ammonium oxid vessel and anaerob ammonium oxid equip a method for oper an anaerob ammonium oxid vessel in anaerob ammonium oxid in which ammonium and nitrit in water to be treat are simultan denitrifi by anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria , the method compris the step of : withdraw a part of the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria from one anaerob ammonium oxid vessel in which the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria have been acclimat , andintroduc the withdrawn anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria into anoth anaerob ammonium oxid vessel in which acclimat is to be carri out to perform start-up oper , wherein the anaerob ammonium oxid bacteria have been acclimat in the one anaerob ammonium oxid vessel are provid as microbe-immobil materi in which the bacteria are attach to and immobil on immobil materi or entrap and immobil in immobil materi .
