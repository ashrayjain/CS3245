method and apparatu for gener electr use recycl air from a comput server in one embodi , the invent is a method and apparatu for recycl exhaust air expel from a comput server ( e.g. , a unit includ microprocessor such as a standard server or a mainfram ) . in one embodi , at least one windmil ( e.g. , a standard windmil or a wind turbin ) is driven by the exhaust air from at least one server unit , and the at least one windmil in turn drive a gener . therefor , energi previous wast in the form of exhaust is har and reus to provid power to the server system . the method and apparatu also reduc the demand place on ventil system need to cool server environ , further reduc the amount of energi consum and/or wast in the oper of a server system . in one embodi , the electr power from the gener unit is either recycl into the power grid . in anoth embodi , the recycl air is use to charg batteri that might be avail as power standbi unit .
