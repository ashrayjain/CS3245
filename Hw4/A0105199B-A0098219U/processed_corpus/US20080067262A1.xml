aerosol dispens assembl have voc-fre propel and dispens mechan therefor an aerosol dispens assembl is provid that enabl a compress ga propel to be use to deliv liquid product in a fine mist , wherebi the droplet of the mist have mean sauter diamet of less than 35 .mu.m . the dispens system includ the use of a compress ga propel that is solubl in the liquid product at room temperatur but that ha a reduc solubl in the liquid product at temperatur exceed room temperatur the system also includ a valv attach to a pressur contain contain the liquid product and ga propel . the valv includ an actuat cap that ha a swirl chamber and an exit orific and a built-in heater that at least partial surround the swirl chamber . as the propel and liquid product stream exit the actuat cap , the heater heat the exit stream therebi decreas the solubl of the compress ga propel in the liquid product , result in cavit or the format of compress ga bubbl in the exit stream which produc unstabl small ligament of liquid product in the exit stream the small ligament are natur convert to small droplet have small diamet the droplet may then undergo secondari atom to further reduc their size .
