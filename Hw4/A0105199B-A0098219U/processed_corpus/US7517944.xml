process for produc polycarbon provid a process for produc a polycarbon which compris react an aqueou alkali solut of a dihydr phenol with phosgen in the presenc of an organ solvent to produc a polycarbon oligom and subsequ polycondens the oligom , wherein an emuls solut of a polycarbon oligomer-contain organ solvent obtain in the polycarbon oligom product step is introduc into a coalesc to separ the emuls solut into a polycarbon oligomer-contain organ solvent phase and an aqueou phase , and the polycarbon oligomer-contain organ solvent phase is subject to polycondens . thu the emuls solut of a polycarbon oligomer-contain organ solvent obtain in the polycarbon oligom product step is effici separ to reduc the content of impurity-contain water in the oligom for produc a polycarbon have excel qualiti and to a obtain wastewat have a low content of organ materi .
