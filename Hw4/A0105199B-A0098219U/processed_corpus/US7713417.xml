method for wastewat treatment with resourc recoveri and reduc residu solid gener a wastewat treatment system is provid includ an aerob membran bioreactor and an anaerob digest system connect to receiv wast solid continu from the aerob membran bioreactor and also connect to return effluent from the anaerob digest system continu to the aerob membran bioreactor . further , a process is provid for treat wastewat includ the step of wast a volum fraction of organ cell mass from an aerob membran bioreactor to an anaerob digest system and maintain a solid retent time ( srt ) in the bioreactor that is ( 1 ) greater than a time need to achiev growth of organ suitabl for convert carbonac biochem oxygen demand ( cbod ) into cell mass and ( 2 ) less than a time at which substanti decay of the organ occur . the system and process may further includ option pretreat and/or phosphoru and/or nitrogen remov downstream of the membran bioreactor system .
