counter-pressur filtrat of protein a method is disclos for filter a protein in a liquid mixtur in a manner that doe not substanti damag or otherwis limit the recoveri of the protein in the filtrat filtrat . the method gener includ pass a liquid mixtur contain a protein ( e.g. , an aqueou vwf mixtur ) through a filter while appli a counter pressur to the liquid mixtur filtrat to accur reduc and control the pressur differenti across the filter . the disclos method ha the advantag that rel high filtrat flow rate can be achiev at rel low pressur differenti , in contrast to high pressur differenti , which actual reduc the filtrat flow rate of protein liquid mixtur . further , the method can recov substanti all of the protein that is initi present in the liquid mixtur .
