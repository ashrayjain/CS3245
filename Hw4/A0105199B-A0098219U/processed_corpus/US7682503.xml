filtrat and surg with no move part an improv and more effici design for an air driven alga filtrat system is achiev becaus there are no move part other than an air pump , and the air is use twice . after use air to circul water through a filtrat unit , the air , still under pressur , is separ from the water . the air is then plumb to other apparatus or use for cool . thi allow the filter to be util use less electr . the water is de-gass befor reach the alga filter . therefor , no splash guard is necessari to prevent water from splash the light . with no splash guard , lower wattag light can be use to illumin the alga . thi also increas the effici of thi system . thi filter also lend itself to maintain a reef aquarium .
