method for recov organic-inorgan element-dop metal oxid from hydrolys metal compound associ with contamin water treatment the present invent relat to a method for recov an organic-inorgan element-dop metal oxid from a hydrolys metal compound , accompani with contamin water treatment . the present invent compris step of : a ) ad a hydrolys metal compound as a coagul to a contamin water to form a separ floc between the hydrolys metal compound and contamin present in contamin water ; b ) separ the separ floc and the pre-treat water after floccul treatment ; and c ) calcin the separ floc over 500.degre . c. to produc an organic-inorgan element-dop metal oxid . more prefer , the present invent further compris subject the pre-treat water of the step b ) to a microwav treatment to caus a photocatalyt degrad of an organ contamin that remain in the pre-treat water , with the assist of the remain hydrolys metal compound . a novel titanium compound is found as an altern coagul instead of iron and aluminum salt which most wide use in water treatment . abil , capac and effici of floccul as the propos titanium coagul are similar to those of fecl.sub.3 and alum coagul in term of remov organ matter . titania produc by calcin of the separ floc after ticl.sub.4 floccul is mainli dope with c and p atom .
