method for recov fluorine-contain emulsifi an aqueou solut contain a fluorine-contain emulsifi in a low concentr of at least 1 ppm by mass and at most 1 % by mass ( e.g. , coagul wast water after an emuls polymer of a fluoropolym and/or an aqueou solut obtain by wash with an aqueou solut a wast ga from a dri process and/or a heat treat process of the fluoropolym ) is subject to vacuum concentr under a pressur of at most 100 kpa and a temperatur of the aqueou solut of at most 100.degre . c. by mean of a heat tube surfac evapor type concentr equip with a heat pump or the like , and the fluorine-contain emulsifi is recov from a highli concentr aqueou solut contain the fluorine-contain emulsifi in a higher concentr of at least 5 % by mass . accord to the present method , the fluorine-contain emulsifi can be recov with a high yield from a low-concentr liquid such as coagul wast water of a fluoropolym .
