apparatu and method for osmot membran distil a method of enhanc the concentr of a first inorgan compound in a first aqueou solut of a first process of a heavi chemic plant , the method compris ( a ) feed the first solut have the first compound at a first concentr and a first water vapor pressur to an osmot membran distil mean compris a hydrophob , ga and water vapor permeabl membran separ ( i ) a first chamber for receiv the first solut , from ( ii ) a second chamber for receiv a receiv feed aqueou solut have a second water vapor pressur lower than the first water vapor pressur ; ( b ) feed the receiv aqueou feed solut to the second chamber as to effect transfer of water vapor through the membran from the first chamber to the second chamber , and to produc ( i ) a result first solut have a second concentr of the first compound greater than the first concentr and ( ii ) a dilut receiv feed aqueou solut ; and ( c ) collect the result first solut . the apparatu and method are of particular valu in electrolyt haloalkali product plant in offer reduc capit and oper re-concentr and dilut cost .
