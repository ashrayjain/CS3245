computer-vis system for classif and spatial local of bound 3d-object the invent relat to a system and method for recognit , classif and spatial local of bound 3d-object . in particular it relat to a computer method for recognit , classif and local of object . the method compris gener of a train databas base on a larg number of train view record by a camera or construct use a cad represent of an object . characterist curv are deriv from the train view , and primit of the curv are detect . intrins and extrins descriptor of featur are store in the databas togeth with data about the object class and pose of the view . final the recognit take place in two stage : first the intrins descriptor of the recognit view are compar with those of the databas . second , among the best match featur it is explor which featur agre mutual in the sens that they suggest the same object class at the same pose .
