method for treat wastewat and sludg a method and an apparatu for treat organ wastewat and sludg which remark reduc the gener amount of sludg at a much lower run cost , and which reduc the size and the capac of the solubil tank . the method and apparatu for treat sludg employ a biolog treatment system , wherein a biolog treatment of wastewat is carri out , and a solid-liquid separ unit for separ a solid from a liquid in the wastewat after the biolog treatment , to obtain a treat wastewat and a sludg . the apparatu ha a mean for obtain a withdrawn sludg from a part of the sludg and an alkali-treat tank , wherein an alkali-treat of the withdrawn sludg is carri out . the apparatu also ha a biolog solubil tank which solubil the sludg after the alkali-treat under an anaerob , anox or microaerophil condit , and a mean for recycl the solubil sludg to the biolog treatment system .
