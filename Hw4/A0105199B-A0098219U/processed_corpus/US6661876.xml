mobil miniatur x-ray sourc a mobil , miniatur x-ray sourc includ a low-pow consumpt cathod element for mobil , and an anod optic creat a field free region to prolong the life of the cathod element . an electr field is appli to an anod and a cathod that are dispos on opposit side of an evacu tube . the anod includ a target materi to produc x-ray in respons to impact of electron . the cathod includ a cathod element to produc electron that are acceler toward the anod in respons to the electr field between the anod and the cathod . the tube can have a length less than approxim 3 inch , and a diamet or width less than approxim 1 inch . the cathod element can includ a low-pow consumpt cathod element with a low power consumpt less than approxim 1 watt . the power sourc can includ a batteri power sourc . a field-fre region can be posit at the anod to resist posit ion acceler back toward the cathod element . an anod tube can be dispos at the anod between the anod and the cathod , and electr coupl to the anod so that the anod and the anod tube have the same electr potenti , to form the field-fre region .
