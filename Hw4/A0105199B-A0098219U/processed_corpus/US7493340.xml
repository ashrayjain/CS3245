imag retriev base on relev feedback an improv imag retriev process base on relev feedback use a hierarch ( per-featur ) approach in compar imag . multipl queri vector are gener for an initi imag by extract multipl low-level featur from the initi imag . when determin how close a particular imag in an imag collect match the initi imag , a distanc is calcul between the queri vector and correspond low-level featur vector extract from the particular imag . onc these individu distanc are calcul , they are combin to gener an overal distanc that repres how close the two imag match . accord to other aspect , relev feedback receiv regard previous retriev imag is use dure the queri vector gener and the distanc determin to influenc which imag are subsequ retriev .
