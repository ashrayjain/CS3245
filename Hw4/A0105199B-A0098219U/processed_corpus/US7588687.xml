method for separ electrolyt the present invent is direct to a method of separ electrolyt by size exclus chromatographi use neutral micropor sorbent materi . two type of sorbent have shown to be most promis : micropor non-function hypercrosslink polystyren materi with a pore size compar to diamet of hydrat electrolyt ion , and micropor activ carbon prepar by pyrolysi of hypercrosslink polystyren sorbent bead . in thi method , a column compris hypercrosslink polystyren sorbent bead is load with a solut of electrolyt , and then elut with water . electrolyt with the largest ion elut first , and those with the smallest ion elut last . select of separ rise with the concentr of the mixtur to be separ . with concentr initi mixtur , concentr of separ compon exce their concentr in the initi mixtur .
