braid-reinforc composit hollow fiber membran a braid-reinforc composit hollow fiber membran is disclos . the braid-reinforc composit hollow fiber membran compris a reinforc materi of a tubular braid and a polym resin thin film coat on the surfac of the tubular braid is character in that : the tubular braid compris multifila made of monofila have a fine of 0.01 to 0.4 denier , and the peel strength of the tubular braid and a polym resin thin film coat on the surfac thereof is 1 to 10 mpa . in the composit hollow fiber membran , the fine of the mono filament constitut the tubular braid of the reinforc materi is small , that is , 0.01 to 0.4 denier , thu the surfac area of the tubular braid contact with the polym resin thin film is increas . thu , the peel strength of the tubular braid and the polym resin thin film coat on the surfac thereof is excel , and at the same time , the initi wet properti of the composit hollow fiber membran is excel , that is , 80 to 120 % , due to a capillari tube phenomenon or the like .
