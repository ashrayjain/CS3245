system and method for batteri calibr in portabl comput devic describ is a method which includ a step of initi a calibr state of a batteri statu system . the calibr state includ charg a batteri to a first threshold valu ; discharg the batteri to a second threshold valu ; and calibr the batteri statu system base on the first and second threshold valu . subsequ , the method includ a step of exit the calibr state . describ is also a portabl comput devic which includ invad a batteri ; a control ; and an applic execut on the control for perform calibr of a batteri statu system of the batteri . the applic drive the batteri to a threshold state and perform the calibr when the batteri reach the threshold state .
