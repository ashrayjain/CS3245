digit control charg current regul a method for regul the batteri charg current with improv loop stabil is achiev . key element of thi invent is a digit low pass filter within the feedback loop of the regul , which is built by an up/down counter , a digital-to-analog-convert and a variabl frequenc oscil . to achiev regul loop stabil in state-of-the-art analog design , the domin pole ha to be select at a suffici low frequenc , which caus the regul to be too slow for puls charg current . the disclos invent replac the analog feedback circuit with a digit low pass filter arrang . it achiev stabil by be abl to choos the low pass filter time constant longer than the supply-voltage-pulse-width with reduc circuit complex and less electron circuit resourc . furthermor , the time characterist can be vari dure normal oper by modifi the oscil frequenc and by preset the up/down counter to defin valu . the circuit is capabl of regul a charg current from a puls power suppli , such as a rectifi sine wave power suppli without capacitor and can provid a pulse-width-modul charg current . the circuit make sure that the maximum peak current of the batteri is n't exceed by sampl onli when there is suffici suppli voltag .
