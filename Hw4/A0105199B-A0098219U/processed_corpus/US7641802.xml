wastewat treatment method and wastewat treatment equip in a micronanobubbl reaction vessel 3 of wastewat treatment equip , wastewat contain organ matter is treat with micronanobubbl . thereaft , the wastewat is introduc into an aerat tank 7 . part of organ matter in the wastewat is oxid in the micronanobubbl reaction vessel 3 by micronanobubbl treatment prior to treatment with activ of microorgan enhanc in the aerat tank 7 . after organ matter load is thu reduc , the treatment water is introduc into the aerat tank 7 , in which microorgan exist in high concentr due to submerg membran 17 , so that the organ matter in wastewat can be effect treat . thi make it possibl to accomplish miniatur of the aerat tank 7 , reduct in scale of the whole equip and therefor reduct in initi cost . also , a photocatalyst tank 22 is provid downstream of the aerat tank 7 , so that a minut amount of organ matter unaffect by the microbi treatment alon can be oxid at high-level by use a photocatalyst plate 24 .
