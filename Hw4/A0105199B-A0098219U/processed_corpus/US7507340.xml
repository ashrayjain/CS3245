ion process element with composit media an ion process element employ composit media dispos in a porou substrat , for facilit remov of select chemic speci from a fluid stream . the ion process element includ a porou fibrou glass substrat impregn by composit media have one or more activ compon support by a matrix materi of polyacrylonitril . the activ compon are effect in remov , by variou mechan , one or more constitu from a fluid stream pass through the ion process element . due to the poros and larg surfac area of both the composit medium and the substrat in which it is dispos , a high degre of contact is achiev between the activ compon and the fluid stream be process . further , the poros of the matrix materi and the substrat facilit use of the ion process element in high volum applic where it is desir to effect process a high volum flow .
