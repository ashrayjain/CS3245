imag learn , automat annot , retriev method , and devic a first imag have annot is segment into one or more imag region . imag featur vector and text featur vector are extract from all the imag region to obtain an imag featur matrix and a text featur matrix . the imag featur matrix and the text featur matrix are project into a sub-spac to obtain the project imag featur matrix and the text featur matrix . the project imag featur matrix and the text featur matrix are store . first link between the imag region , second link between the first imag and the imag region , third link between the first imag and the annot , and fourth link between the annot are establish . weight of all the link are calcul . a graph show a triangular relationship between the first imag , imag region , and annot is obtain base on all the link and the weight of the link .
