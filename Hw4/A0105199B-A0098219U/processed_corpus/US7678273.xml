membran plate and filter element a filter unit includ membran plate place togeth parallel to one anoth , which at least in zone around connect element for the purpos of drain permeat are connect togeth liquid-tight . the membran plate becaus of their shape and after two membran plate have been place one on top of the other are provid for manufactur a liquid-tight connect or a seal by weld . as a result unfilt liquid flow through between the membran plate and contamin of the permeat within a volum situat between the connect element is prevent . over a number of connect element and zone locat in between it is possibl to attach a hollow profil , which is closed-off at it end . thi hollow profil in a liquid-tight manner surround discharg open of the connect element and the zone locat in between with posit materi engag . as a result , a permeat collect channel is form , out of which and through a permeat discharg the permeat can be extract through suction .
