water treatment system a water treatment system have a biolog treatment step ( a secondari treatment step ) and a membran separ step ( a tertiari treatment step ) , wherein a portion of the raw water to be treat and/or a portion of the primarili treat water in the pretreat step are biolog treat and suppli into a reaction tank in the membran separ step as the main channel system , while the remaind the raw water to be treat and/or the remaind of the primarili treat water in the pretreat step are ad togeth with a floccul agent to the reaction tank in the membran separ step , and then the membran separ is conduct in the membran separ step .
