on-demand portabl chlorin dioxid gener an on-demand portabl chlorin dioxid gener ha a reagent bound medium in a first enclos volum ; a complementari reagent solut in a second enclos volum , and a structur for select between a first posit where the complementari reagent solut is forc through the reagent bound medium and a second posit where said complementari reagent solut remain isol from the reagent bound ion exchang medium , where a clo2 solut is gener onli dure period when the structur for forc is actuat . the clo2 solut can be discharg for use as a portabl sprayer that can be use to treat surfac infect by anthrax or other biolog contamin . when the bound reagent is chlorit , the complementari reagent is an acid or an oxid . when the bound reagent is an acid or an oxid , the complementari reagent solut is a chlorit solut .
