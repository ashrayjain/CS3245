batteri charger for portabl electron equip there is offer a batteri charger for a portabl electron devic that ha a simpl structur and is capabl of detect that the portabl electron devic is connect to the batteri charger . a first power suppli line 13 is connect to a posit termin ( + ) of a recharg batteri 10 , while a ground line 15 is connect to a neg termin ( - ) of the recharg batteri 10 . an output transistor 11 is connect between the first power suppli line 13 and a second power suppli line 14 . the output transistor 11 is connect to a vbu termin of a usb connector 12 through the second power suppli line 14 . a control 20 output a voltag of an h level to the vbu termin to detect a chang in a voltag at the vbu termin , and judg whether the portabl electron devic 30 is connect to the usb connector 12 base on a result of the detect . the control 20 turn the output transistor 11 on when the portabl electron devic 30 is judg to be connect to the usb connector 12 .
