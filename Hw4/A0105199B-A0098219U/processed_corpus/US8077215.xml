apparatu for detect blink state of eye a state-of-ey distinguish mean calcul a featur valu that repres a state of an eye , for an eye-area base on pixel data of pixel that constitut the eye-area . a threshold valu set mean calcul a first threshold valu repres a featur valu at a first transit point from an open state to a close state and a second threshold valu repres a featur valu at a second transit point from the close state to the open state , base on a featur valu calcul for a target eye when the target eye is open . a blink state detect mean detect the blink state of the eye correspond to the eye-area , by sequenti compar featur valu which are sequenti calcul for a seri of frame imag by the state-of-ey distinguish mean with one of the first threshold valu and the second threshold valu .
