method for evalu cation-exchang resin and method for control water treatment system use the same a method for a cation-exchang resin wherein a strongli acid cation-exchang resin is contact with an aqueou elut solut and the polystyrenesulfon acid be elut from thi resin is measur , which compris set a plural of molecular weight rang in the molecular weight distribut of the polystyrenesulfon acid elut , and evalu the perform capabl of the cation-exchang resin base on the correspond relationship of each molecular weight rang with the amount elut in said each molecular weight rang . the evalu method allow on-target and precis evalu of the perform capabl of a cation-exchang resin be independ of the structur of a base resin and the circumst under which it is use , which lead to the determin of the optimum time for the exchang of a resin in a water treatment system use a cation-exchang resin , and thu to the extens of exchang of a resin and the reduct of an oper cost for the system .
