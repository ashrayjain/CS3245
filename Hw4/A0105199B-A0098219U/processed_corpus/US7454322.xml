method for model hydrocarbon degrad in an oil deposit method of model the biodegrad of hydrocarbon trap in an oil reservoir or trap through the action of the bacteri popul in an underli aquifer.from data rel to the reservoir studi , concern the form and the height of the reservoir , the physic characterist of the porou medium , the thick of the transit zone between the hydrocarbon and the water , the composit of the hydrocarbon , of the flow of electron acceptor enter the reservoir and data rel to the bacteri popul in the aquif , model is perform by discret the reservoir by mean of a grid wherein the height of each grid cell is the thick of the transit zone , and the variat , over the height of the reservoir , of the proport in heavi fraction of hydrocarbon under the effect of the biodegrad is determin by iter adjust in each grid cell of the bacteri popul to the amount of hydrocarbon avail , the pore space avail , the amount of electron acceptor present in the reservoir and the degrad capac of said population.appl : determin of the composit of oil in a reservoir and notabl of the locat of the heaviest fraction .
