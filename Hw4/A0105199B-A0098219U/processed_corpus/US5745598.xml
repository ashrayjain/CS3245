statist base segment and parameter method for dynam process , identif , and verif of binari contour imag an improv method of segment and feature-bas descript for verification/authent of contour imag ( e.g . handwritten signatur ) is describ , direct to a system which employ a set of paramet extract from a dynam descript of a contour imag templat to perform segment of incom contour imag be verified/authent by the system . the prefer embodi would consist of a central process unit incorpor a high-perform comput , and of mani autonom verif unit ( e.g . atm machin ) equip with inexpens process devic . in the central process unit , a contour imag templat is segment into stroke accord to the segment paramet which are comput use select properti of the mathemat transform for said contour imag templat . for illustr purpos , a discret cosin transform ( dct ) is be use . the segment paramet , select global paramet of the contour imag , and select featur of the extract stroke are memor in a portabl memori devic . in a verif unit , an incom contour imag is normal accord to the global paramet retriev from the portabl memori devic , then the incom contour imag is segment accord to the retriev segment paramet , and final the select featur are comput for the extract stroke . the incom contour imag is accept if the comput featur and the correspond featur retriev from the portabl memori devic satisfi a predetermin similar criterion .
