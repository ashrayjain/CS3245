enzymat decontamin composit and method for enzymat decontamin by inactiv of hazard agent are provid . hazard agent of microbi and chemic origin can be neutral by h.sub.2o.sub.2 . the method describ herein provid for enzymat product of h.sub.2o.sub.2 in situ use oxidoreductas enzym that use oxygen as an acceptor and their alcohol substrat . the enzymat produc h.sub.2o.sub.2 and correspond aldehyd have potent antimicrobi properti . the enzymat produc h.sub.2o.sub.2 also can detoxifi chemic agent in situ . the decontamin power of the oxidoreductas enzym that use oxygen as an acceptor may be amplifi by addit of reagent , such as acetyl donor or base catalyst that , in the presenc of h.sub.2o.sub.2 , yield peroxi acid deriv and hydroperoxi anion . such deriv can neutral biolog and chemic agent , thu provid a broadli applic decontamin method . in addit , catalyt product of h.sub.2o.sub.2 in situ result in control synthesi of decontamin reagent at their point of use , mitig the need to store , transport and dispos of hydrogen peroxid solut in the field .
