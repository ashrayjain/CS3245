energy-bas process for fluid treatment and system thereof a process for treat a fluid which compris the step of expos the fluid to ultraviolet radiat and high-energi ioniz radiat . it ha been discov that combin ultraviolet radiat with high-energi ioniz radiat in the treatment of a fluid result in synergist perform of the treatment process -- e.g. , improv in the inactiv or kill of microorgan in the fluid , in destruct of organ contamin and the like . more specif , fluid treatment perform is improv to a level typic not possibl when use ultraviolet radiat and high-energi ioniz radiat separ .
