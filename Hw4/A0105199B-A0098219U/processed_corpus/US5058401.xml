wash , dehydr and dri machin in the machin of thi invent , a rotation-support member is provid in an outer tub for contain water so that the rotation-support member can rotat about a vertic axi . the rotation-support member support a perfor inner tub rotat about a horizont axi . a heat mean heat air in the inner tub . when the laundri is wash or rins , the laundri is load in the inner tub , water is suppli to the outer tub until the water reach insid the inner tub , and the inner tub is rotat about the horizont axi . the laundri is prevent from jump out of the inner tub dure the wash and rins process due to board or net provid in the inner tub . when the wash or rins laundri is dehydr , water is drain from the outer tub , the rotation-support member and the inner tub are rotat togeth about the vertic axi in the same direct at the same high speed . when the dehydr laundri is dri , the inner tub is rotat about the horizont axi , heat air is suppli to the inner tub , and the laundri is uniformli expos to the air to dri . the humid air use for dri the laundri is dehumidifi , moistur in the air is drain to the outsid , and dehumidifi air is recircul in the machin . the machin of thi invent shift from one process to anoth without chang it attitud . consequ , the machin is simpli construct and inexpens manufactur .
