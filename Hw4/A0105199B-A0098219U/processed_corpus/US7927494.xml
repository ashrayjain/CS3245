water reus method in clean devic there disclos a water reus method in which a surfact is easili remov from surfactant-includ for-treat water in a clean devic , wherebi water can be reus , and an adsorb can easili be regener onli by expos the adsorb to an electrolyt solut , and a wash machin includ the function . the method includ a surfact adsorpt treatment step of perform a treatment to adsorb and remov a surfact in surfactant-includ for-treat water such as clean water and rins water use in a wash machin w by hydrotalcit as an anion exchang or zeolit as a cation exchang , and a water reus step of use , in the wash machin w , the for-treat water treat in the surfact adsorpt treatment step .
