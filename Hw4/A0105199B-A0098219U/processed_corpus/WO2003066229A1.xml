method for produc aerosol /reson caviti ( bubbl ) the invent relat to method for produc aerosol/ reson caviti ( bubbl ) , control physico-chem process in a heterophas medium ( media ) and can be use for the chemic , petrochem and pharmaceut industri and also at home for medicin and devic produc combust mixtur for intern combust engin ( for exampl , in the nozzl of a diesel engin ) . the invent method for produc aerosol/ reson caviti ( bubbl ) consist in select the characterist of the macrostructur of a produc aerosol / reson caviti ( bubbl ) and expos a dispers fluid medium to the action of ultrason oscil in a standing-wav mode . the paramet of said ultrason oscil for form a fine aerosol / reson caviti ( bubbl ) are modifi until a reson spectr is obtain , said paramet are maintain on a reson frequenc of the select macrostructur which is regener afterward . the invent method make it possibl to improv the effici of the structuris of a reaction medium dure physico-chem process .
