modular system for suppli by magnet field in anim telemetri the present invent relat to a modular system ( 1 ) for provid an electron devic ( 2 ) with energi via a magnet field . the electron devic ( 2 ) is an implant for laboratori anim , the purpos of which is to measur and send inform relat to physiolog function of the anim for subsequ analysi and studi . the implant system ha a temporari energi storag modul . the system which provid energi via the magnet field for suppli the implant is accommod in the cage of the anim and the modular of said system allow the latter to be appli to anim hous which are as larg as desir . the system allow prolong studi ( in which the use of batteri is rule out ) while the anim move freeli in the cage thereof without ani type of restrict . the system also allow the anim to be remov from the magnet field gener area for limit period of time without lose the function of the implant owe to a lack of suppli .
