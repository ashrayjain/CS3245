biotreat of as-contain hydroxid sludg the invent disclos a biotechnolog process for the treatment of hydroxid sludg contain as produc in potabl water product process which use feci.sub.3 as a coagul . the process seek to modifi the physicochem properti of the produc sludg in such a way to facilit the use of mechan dehydr method that allow decreas the sludg volum and facilit it final dispos . the process entail : prepar of an inoculum of sulfat reduc microorgan from the sludg to be treat ; combin the sludg to be treat , the srb inoculum , and nutrient at a control temperatur for about 5 day in an anaerob reactor with enough mix to allow sludg homogen such that no untreat zone remain ; decant the treat sludg for a period of approxim 3 day , recov the clarifi liquid and subject the sediment to a dewat process through filtrat or centrifug ; filter the solid residu come from the decant ; and character the final residu .
