method for gener fractur water system and method have been develop for reclaim water contamin with the expect rang of contamin typic associ with produc water in order to produc a treat water have a qualiti adequ for reus as a fractur water . the system includ anaerob digest the contamin water , follow by aerat the water to enhanc biolog digest . after aerat , the water is separ use a flotat oper that effect remov the spent friction reduc agent and allow the treat water to be reclaim and reus as fractur water , even though it retain level of contamin , includ boron and methanol , that would prevent it discharg to the environ under exist standard . the treat water ha had a suffici amount of the gellation-inhibit contamin , such as acrylamid friction reduc compound , remov to allow the treat water to be an econom viabl fractur water .
