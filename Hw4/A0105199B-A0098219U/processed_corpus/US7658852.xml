ro membran clean method direct-osmosi ( do ) method for clean a semi-perm membran in a ro separ modul , the membran have a feed side with foulant locat thereon , and an opposit permeat side . a normal ro separ process in the same modul includ : feed , under gaug pressur pgr , raw salin solut have osmot pressur por to the membran feed side ; collect permeat ( solvent ) have osmot pressur pop from the permeat side , under gaug pressur pgp ; and remov residu brine from the membran feed side . the method compris feed to the feed side of the membran , for a predetermin inject time , super salin solut have osmot pressur po > por , such that backward flow of permeat toward the feed side of the membran is provid so as to lift the foulant from the feed side .
