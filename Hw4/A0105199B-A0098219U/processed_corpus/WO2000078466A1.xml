high-effici ga dissolv devic a high-effici ga dissolv devic ( 10 ) which ha a diameter-expand nozzl with a collis member , wherein the shear forc and cavit of water produc in the inner space of the diameter-expand nozzl are util to effici atom air , etc . thi devic ( 10 ) compris a nozzl main bodi ( 11 ) have a water introduc ( 14 ) , a ga feeder ( 16 ) and a diameter-expand nozzl ( 17 ) , and a collis plate ( 18 ) fix to the nozzl main bodi . the water introduc ( 14 ) discharg high-pressur water , introduc through a water feed port ( 12 ) , from a discharg port ( 13 ) . the ga feeder ( 16 ) is provid with a ga introduc port ( 15 ) in the water introduc ( 14 ) and mix ga into the high-pressur water by ejector action . the diameter-expand nozzl ( 17 ) posit gener cavit in the inner space with a forwardli expand diamet by the flow of high-pressur water discharg from the discharg port ( 13 ) . the collis plate ( 18 ) is dispos with a gap defin in front of the diameter-expand nozzl ( 17 ) , so that the water mix with fine air bubbl discharg from the diameter-expand nozzl ( 17 ) is dispers around .
