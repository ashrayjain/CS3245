oil/wat separ system an evapor for receiv wast fluid stream and produc separ stream of an evapor fluid and a condens liquid for use in industri wast treatment ha a curv pathway bound by a case have an inlet port through which the wast fluid enter the case . the case defin a pathway have a flow direct therein through which the wast fluid stream flow , and within which case the evapor fluid is produc . the case ha a drain beneath the pathway through which the condens pass , and an outlet through which the evapor fluid is drawn . a seri of fin of elong aerofoil cross-sect are locat in and extend across the pathway in the flow direct of the wast fluid stream flow along the pathway . the case is curv and the fin are arrang parallel to a tangent of the curv .
