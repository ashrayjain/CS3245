cruis aerat apparatu and method a cruis aerat apparatu and a method are describ . the cruis aerat apparatu compris an aerat devic for circul the water in an aquat pool , at least one conduct element connect to the aerat devic for conduct the aerat devic along a travel rout , and a control . the at least one conduct element can be a rope or a float loop use as a separ line of a swim pool . the pool water is drawn and pressur by the aerat devic and then eject from nozzl of the aerat devic . the nozzl on the front side and the rear side of the travel rout of the aerat devic produc differ counterforc . the aerat devic is driven along the travel rout by the differ between the counterforc of the front side and the rear side of the travel rout . at least one switch is instal to control the open and the close of the nozzl , and is locat on the side of the aerat devic provid larger counterforc . the on/off of the at least one switch is control by the control , so that the counterforc magnitud of the front side and the rear side of the aerat devic can be interchang to drive the aerat devic to move reciproc .
