document imag featur valu gener devic , document imag featur valu gener method , and document imag featur valu gener program when connect region contact in one imag and are separ in the other imag with respect to a centroid of connect region obtain from a regist and a binari imag of a regist imag , differ featur point are extract due to contact and separ , and so featur valu which are match to each other could not be acquir . a document imag featur valu gener devic is a document imag featur valu gener devic which extract featur point from an input imag which is input and gener a featur valu from the featur point and includ integr featur point extract mean and featur valu gener mean . the integr featur point extract mean determin connect region from the input imag which is input , comput centroid of the connect region and the featur point , integr at least some of the connect region , and obtain an integr featur point from a centroid of an integr connect region . the featur valu gener mean set a princip featur point from among the featur point obtain and gener a featur valu of the integr connect region from neighbor featur point which are arrang near to the princip featur point and the integr featur point .
