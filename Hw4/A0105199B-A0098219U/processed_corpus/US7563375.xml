direct osmosi clean a method of clean a foul ro membran in a modul for ro separ , the membran have feed side and permeat side , the foulant accumul at the feed side . the clean method compris : feed concentr salin solut to the feed side of the ro membran under the high gaug pressur of the normal ro separ process ; feed dilut salin solut to the permeat side of the ro membran under higher pressur than the permeat pressur of the normal ro process , so that a net drive differenti .delta.pn is direct to the feed side , wherebi the solvent is be suck from the permeat side to the feed side , penetr into the interfac between the membran and the accumul foulant , and separ the foulant from the membran surfac ; and withdraw the concentr salin solut togeth with the separ foulant and the penetr solvent from the feed side of the ro membran .
