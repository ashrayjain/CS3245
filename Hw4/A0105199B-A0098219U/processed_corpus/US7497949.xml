system and method for oxygen an aerob sludg digest a system and method for oxygen an aerob sludg digest is provid . the disclos embodi includ an aerob sludg digest tank or vessel have a mechan agit contactor dispos therein , an oxygen inject subsystem adapt to inject oxygen into the digest tank proxim the mechan agit contactor . the embodi of the mechan agit contactor includ an agit or impel dispos within the draft tube which make the draft tube the primari site for the gas-liquid mix . in particular , the agit or impel is adapt to creat ga bubbl have an averag diamet between about 0.3 mm and 3.0 mm which are then dispers into the aerob digest . the mass transfer effici associ with the present system and method is enhanc from the combin effect of oxygen dissolut into the sludg and greater bubbl resid time .
