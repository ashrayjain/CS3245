composit and method for reduc chemic oxygen demand in water a method and composit for reduc chemic oxygen demand is present . the composit includ a persulf donor and a transit metal catalyst in contact with the persulf donor . when the composit is contact by water , the transit metal catalyst react with persulf and reduc the persulf concentr in the water . the composit allow the use of persulf , which is known to caus irrit to user of aquat facil ( e.g. , pool , spa ) that come in contact with it . as the persulf concentr is reduc rapidli in the water by the catalyz reaction , the persulfate-contain clean product may even be use while the aquat facil are be use . option , a free halogen donor may be incorpor into the composit . the composit may be in the form of powder , granul ( coat or uncoat ) , or agglomer .
