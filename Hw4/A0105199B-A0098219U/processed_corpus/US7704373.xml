wast fluid or wast water treatment method and it apparatu a method for electrochem oxid decomposit of difficult to decompos compound such as aromat compound , organ chlorin compound , agricultur chemic , dioxin , pcb 's and water solubl polym that are contain in wast fluid , such as print develop wast fluid , factori wast water and industri wast water , and landfil soil seep wast water by carri out electrolysi at a high current densiti to elimin and purifi difficult to decompos substanc in the wast fluid . wast fluid contain difficult to decompos substanc is introduc into an electrolyt chamber have a ferrit electrod anod , electrolysi is perform at a high current densiti of 10 a/dm.sup.2 or higher , hypohalogen acid and activ oxygen are gener in the wast fluid along with a strong anod oxid action be brought about , and the oxid decomposit is repeat by re-circul the wast fluid through a filter , electrolyz and an intermedi collect chamber .
