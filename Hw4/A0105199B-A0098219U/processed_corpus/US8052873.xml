bacteri cultiv system for growth of substrat specif micro-organ for use in industri wastewat remedi a wast treatment method includ the concentr of select strain of bacteria in a select medium in the presenc of nutrient and water , under aerob condit . thi concentr batch is thereaft discharg for downstream applic in wastewat remedi . the present invent employ a cultiv chamber have inlet port and a circular vent port that allow for adequ air introduct and heat releas . aerat is achiev by recircul of the fluid medium from the top of the apparatu through a pipe that run the length of the inner wall and is special configur at the top to minim cell damag . fluid can be rout tangenti in both the clockwis and counterclockwis direct within the chamber . the conic bottom also ha an orific allow for recircul of the fluid medium tangenti to the sidewal . upon complet of the batch cultiv , the medium and bacteria are discharg for downstream applic in wastewat remedi of paper mill , chemic plant , oil refineri , and other industri effluent . the aerat and circul of the fluid is design to limit cell shear and damag yet achiev critic cell mass ( e.g . between 10.sup.7 and 10.sup.10 cfu ( coloni form unit ) per millilit ( ml ) ) and dissolv oxygen uptak rate ( e.g . between about 50 and 1500 ) dure cultiv .
