water treatment method and system use combin of ozon and chlorin gener method and apparatu for effici implement and control of water treatment bypass loop combin ozon and chlorin inject are disclos . combin use of ozon and chlorin exploit high oxid potenti of ozon while retain longer live residu effect of chlorin for high efficaci against contamin , particularli biolog and organ . embodi includ autom monitor and control of chlorin concentr in presenc of high oxid potenti from ozon are disclos , as is an inexpens circuit for use a signal from a redox sensor for control output from an electrolysi cell . also disclos is a multipurpos enclosur that may be use , with differ insert , to implement an electrolysi cell , an ultraviolet ozon gener , an advanc oxid unit , or an eros feeder for ad dissolv salt to water for use in an electrolysi cell . the multipurpos enclosur help reduc cost associ with maintain inventori of differ compon use in water purif system .
