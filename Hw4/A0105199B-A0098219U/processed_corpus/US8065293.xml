self-compact pattern index : store , index and access inform in a graph-lik data structur an index system use a graph-lik data structur that cluster featur index togeth . the minimum atom valu in the data structur is repres as a leaf node which is either a singl featur index or a sequenc of two or more featur index when a minimum sequenc length is impos . root node are form as cluster collect of leaf node and/or other root node . context node are form from root node that are associ with content that is be index . link between a root node and other node each includ a sequenc order valu that is use to maintain the sequenc order for featur index rel to the root node . the collect of node form a graph-lik data structur , where each context node is index accord to the sequenc pattern of featur index . cluster can be split , merg , and promot to increas the effici in search the data structur .
