method for treatment of effluent use puls electr field and solid/liquid separ thi invent disclos the treatment of effluent in which a flow of the said effluent is subject to a puls electr field that modifi physicochem and biolog characterist of the medium , thi modif be use dure a solid/liquid separ oper , of the settlement or membran filtrat type . the solid/liquid separ oper ( 13 , 14 , 15 ) and the applic of a puls electr field ( 12 ) are oper carri out at differ locat along the effluent flow . the puls electr field ha voltag valu , current valu , puls repetit frequenc and voltag front shape characterist chosen such that the requir effluent treatment can be achiev as a function of the locat at which these membran filtrat oper are carri out and a puls electr field is appli .
