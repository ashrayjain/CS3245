apparatu and method for high-spe marker-fre motion captur a high-spe marker-fre motion captur , which is capabl of power detect a bodi 's featur point correspond to a bodi 's end portion such as a head , hand , feet , trunk , arm and leg at a high speed in an illumin chang or background or nois of camera . the extract featur point of the bodi can be directli track stabli in a 3-dimension space . the posit error of the featur point due to the chang of the illumin condit or a shadow can be automat correct and the featur point can be stabli track with respect to overlap and disappear of the featur point . further , when coordin of the middl joint are estim use 3-dimension coordin of the extract featur point of the bodi , the present invent restor a human model by estim the posit of the middl joint of the actor with high accuraci without use a motion databas , therebi secur the stabil and realiti of the 3-dimension motion data requir in the motion captur .
