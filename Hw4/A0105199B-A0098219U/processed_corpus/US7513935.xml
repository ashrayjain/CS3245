mix matrix membran with super water wash silica contain molecular siev and method for make and use the same the present invent provid a method for prepar silica contain molecular siev which may be mix with an organ polym to creat a mix matrix membran . further , thi invent includ a method of make such a mix matrix membran and the membran itself . a process for separ compon gase from a mixtur use the subject mix matrix membran is also describ . the method for prepar silica contain molecular siev compris super water wash silica contain molecular siev to produc water wash molecular siev which are substanti free of surfac remnant . super water wash also ideal lower the concentr of alkali metal in the molecular siev . the water wash siev are suffici free of surfac remnant such that when the water wash siev are subject to a siev wash conduct test , a wash filtrat is produc have a conduct of less than 110 micro mhos/cm , more prefer less than 80 micro mhos/cm , even more prefer less than 50 micro mhos/cm , and most prefer less than 30 micro mhos/cm . it is believ that super wash the siev to thi degre will enhanc , compar to convent prepar techniqu , the abil of the molecular siev to bond with an organ polym to form a highli select and permeabl mix matrix membran .
