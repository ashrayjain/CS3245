water desalin process and apparatu a process and system for purifi water is disclos . for exampl , in one embodi , the process may be use to remov a dival salt , such as calcium sulfat , from a water sourc in order to prevent the dival salt from precipit dure the process . the water sourc , for instanc , may be fed to an ion separ devic , such as an electrodialysi devic . in the electrodialysi devic , an ion exchang take place between the dival salt and anoth salt , such as a monoval salt to produc two concentr salt stream that contain salt have greater solubl in water than the dival salt . in one embodi , the two salt stream that are produc may then be combin to precipit the dival salt in a control manner . dure the process , variou other compon contain within the water feed stream may also be remov from the stream and convert into use product . in one particular embodi , the process is configur to receiv a byproduct stream from a revers osmosi process .
