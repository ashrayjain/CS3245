float diffus air aerat an aerat for mechan induc near laminar flow and control turbul in a liquid wast treatment lagoon or pond . a blower , blower mount platform , diffus modul , aerat manifold , aerat chamber , an adjust , telescop aerat chamber extens , baffl , and buoyanc apparatus attach to a frame . the diffus are locat beneath the surfac of the bodi of liquid at a predetermin , fix depth . the blower suppli air to the diffus and liquid-bubbl mixtur is releas into an aerat chamber where artifici aerat is maxim . the mixtur then rise through the aerat chamber . bubbl dissip and flow condit baffl forc bubbl to coalesc and vertic dissip into the atmospher . the liquid flow over the top of the baffl and a flow manipul rim to radiat outward and parallel to the pond surfac with minimum turbul at an optimum flow discharg rate . the aerat provid optim oxygen transfer at low energi cost .
