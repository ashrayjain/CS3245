plant for purifi water contamin by droplet of hydrocarbonac liquid a unit for purifi water contamin by droplet of hydrocarbonac liquid ha an essenti vertic posit filter , an inlet chamber for the contamin water that is partial defin by a first vertic surfac of the filter , suppli mean for contamin water debouch in the lower portion of the inlet chamber , and outlet mean connect to the upper portion of the inlet chamber for discharg hydrocarbonac liquid separ from the water in the inlet chamber . the oper period between filter clean and/or the hourli capac of the filter is increas by inject fine ga bubbl into the contamin water in least one locat select from locat in the lower portion of the inlet chamber and locat in the suppli mean to produc a stream of ga bubbl upward along the first vertic filter surfac .
