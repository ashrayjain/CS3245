method and apparatu for desalin of seawat a method and an apparatu for the modif of seawat , brine , or alik , to render it suitabl for irrig , industri use , or for further treatment in a drink water purif plant , as well as to extract desir substanc from brine , such as boron , and to clear wast from mine process , by reduc environ endang contamin , like petroleum hydro-carbon , or radioact substanc , as well as inactiv microorgan and viru in biosolid , by mean of expos the substanc to high-intens macrosound , i.e. , altern mechan energi radiat at ( ultra- ) sonic frequenc . the treatment enhanc the separ of salt , or/and other desir materi , from the water , and activ in situ the adsorpt of the materi on sorbefaci substanc suppli to the desalin process in form of dust of pulver , liquefi , or vapor substanc , or by element ( of wall ) of treatment chamber , or filter . the separ of the adsorpt materi togeth with the adsorb salt , or/and ani other extract from the liquid , is accomplish by common techniqu , such as sediment , decant , filter , or ( electrostat ) separ .
