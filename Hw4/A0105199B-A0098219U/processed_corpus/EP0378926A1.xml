a wash , dehydr and dri machin in the machin of thi invent , a rotation-support member is provid in an outer tub ( 15 ) for contain water so that the rotation-support member ( 26 ) can rotat about a vertic axi ( yy ) . the rotation-support member support a perfor inner tub ( 41 ) rotat about a horizont axi ( xx ) . a heat mean ( 141 ) heat air in the inner tub . when the laundri is wash or rins , the laundri is load in the inner tub ( 41 ) , water is suppli to the outer tub ( 15 ) until the water reach insid the inner tub , and the inner tub is rotat about the horizont axi ( xx ) . the laundri is prevent from jump out of the inner tub ( 41 ) dure the wash and rins process due to board ( 45 ) or net ( 44 ) provid in the inner tub . when the wash or rins laundri is dehydr , water is drain from the outer tub , the rotation-support member ( 26 ) and the inner tub ( 41 ) are rotat togeth about the vertic axi ( yy ) in the same direct at the same high speed . when the dehydr laundri is dri , the inner tub ( 41 ) is rotat about the horizont axi ( xx ) , heat air is suppli to the inner tub ( 41 ) , and the laundri is uniformli expos to the air to dri . the humid air use for dri the laundri is dehumidifi , moistur in the air is drain to the outsid , and dehumidifi air is recircul in the machin . the machin of thi invent shift from one process to anoth without chang it attitud . consequ , the machin is simpli construct and inexpens manufactur .
