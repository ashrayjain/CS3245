system and method of reduc organ contamin in feed water a zero liquid discharg ( zld ) power plant ( 20 ) includ an advanc oxid system ( 72 ) for reduc contamin in sourc water ( 70 ) to form feed water ( 40 ) for a boiler ( 24 ) . the system ( 72 ) includ an ozon modul ( 86 ) for appli high concentr ozon to the sourc water ( 70 ) to form a mix stream ( 104 ) , an ozon reactor ( 92 ) in which the mix stream is retain ( 104 ) under pressur , an ultraviolet reactor ( 98 ) downstream from the ozon reactor ( 92 ) for enhanc contamin reduct , and a retent tank ( 103 ) downstream from the reactor ( 98 ) . in one configur , the sourc water ( 70 ) is evapor distil from an evapor ( 52 ) that recycl cool tower blowdown 30 . the system ( 72 ) achiev organ contamin reduct at total organ carbon ( toc ) level of less than three hundr part per billion .
