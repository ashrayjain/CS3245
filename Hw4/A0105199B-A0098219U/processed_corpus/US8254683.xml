code imag process method when a small block area enter a first two-dimension code dure a scan and featur of the imag within the area of a posit in the first two-dimension code coincid with a two-dimension code , the block area is specifi as contain a code and a recognit process is perform in the nearbi area . when the recognit of the two-dimension code ha been success , the area of the first two-dimension code is further extract . when the extract of the area of the first two-dimension code ha been success , the scan use the small block area is further continu to search for a second two-dimension code . with an alreadi recogn entranc to the area of the first two-dimension code , the area is skip to continu the search . the second two-dimension code is detect at a high speed by repeat the oper .
