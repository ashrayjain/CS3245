method for clean and decontamin insid structur contamin by radioact substanc , and clean and decontamin devic vehicl provid is a method for decontamin the insid of a structur contamin by radioact substanc , that remov contamin of floor and wall surfac and ceil , etc. , insid the structur contamin by the radioact substanc , use reduc water as clean water , and purifi and make reusabl wast water use in the decontamin . the method ha : a clean stage in which the reduc water neg charg at a potenti of -400 - -600 mv is scatter on the decontamination-target object contamin by the radioact substanc and brush occur ; a clean wast water recoveri stage in which the clean wast water is recov ; a filtrat stage in which the clean wast water is sent to a filter and the coarse-grain solid compon thereof is filter ; a first adsorpt stage in which the clean wast water is caus to pass through a column fill with a mixtur of hydrogen ion-satur clay and alum or a column fill with a hydrogen ion-satur cation-exchang resin , and cation radioact substanc in the clean wast water are adsorb and remov ; a second adsorpt stage in which the clean wast water is caus to pass through a column fill with a hydroxid ion-satur anion-exchang resin and anion radioact substanc in the clean wast water are adsorb and remov ; a third adsorpt stage in which the clean wast water is caus to pass through a column fill with zeolit and residu radioact substanc in the clean wast water are remov ; and a microbubbl process stage in which the clean wast water is process use air microbubbl and return to water have high biolog activ .
