apparatu and method for treat organic-contain wastewat in treat organic-contain wastewat by a biolog treatment in a stage prior to a advanc treatment such as membran separ or the like , the amount of the biolog metabolit produc in the biolog treatment step is reduc to reduc the amount of the organ substanc flow into the advanc treatment step in a latter stage , therebi make the advanc treatment stabl and effici and effici recov treat water of high qualiti . water anaerob biolog treat in an anaerob reaction tank 11 includ an acid product tank 11a and a uasb reaction tank 11b is subject to a coagul treatment and then to solid-liquid separ in a no . 1 sediment tank 14 . the result separ water is aerob biolog treat water is subject to a coagul treatment and then to solid-liquid separ in a no . 2 sediment tank 24 . then , the result water is subject to a membran separ treatment in a ro membran separ 40 as advanc treatment mean . by perform anaerob biolog treatment , aerob biolog treatment , and solid-liquid separ prior to the advanc treatment mean , organ substanc can be suffici remov , and treatment by the advanc treatment mean can be made stabl and effici .
