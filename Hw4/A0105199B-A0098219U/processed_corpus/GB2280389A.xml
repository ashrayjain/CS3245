nozzl a nozzl for produc a ga microbubble-satur stream of liquid from a stream of liquid supersatur with ga compris a chamber ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) have an inlet ( 8 ) for liquid and a flow channel connect the inlet to an outlet for outflow of the liquid , the nozzl further incorpor a movabl mean ( 6 ) arrang for movement between a first posit , where the mean ( 6 ) co-oper with the bodi of the nozzl so as to form a restrict to the flow channel such that , in use , the passag through the restrict thu form of a stream of liquid supersatur with ga caus ga microbubbl to be form in the liquid , and a second posit , where the flow channel is unrestrict , the mean ( 6 ) be bias toward the second posit but arrang to be driven toward the first posit by the forc of a stream of liquid pass through the nozzl . < imag >
