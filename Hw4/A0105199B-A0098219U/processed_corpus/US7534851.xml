method for purifi wastewat the present invent provid a method for treat water contain phenol materi such as bisphenol a , phenol , para tertiari butyl phenol , and 1,1,1-tri ( hydroxyphenyl ) ethan , as well as water solubl polycarbon oligom , and dispers polycarbon particl by extract the phenol materi from the water use a water immisc organ liquid contain an amin coupl catalyst . the treat water is then steam strip to remov residu organ liquid and the amin . the organ liquid , contain the bisphenol a , phenol , para tertiari butyl phenol , and 1,1,1-tri ( hydroxyphenyl ) ethan , as well as water solubl polycarbon oligom and dissolv polycarbon particl can be fed back to the coupl step of the polycarbon process without further regener or treatment .
