integr apparatu and method for treat liquid a passiv self energ , liquid devic oper entir on capillari action . a microfilt fraction nanolit volum of suspens such as whole blood into suspend particl or cell and liquid fraction . blood , for exampl , is fraction with minim cell lysi , and the filtrat ( plasma ) flux is depend upon design paramet similar to factor control blood filtrat in micropor membran , i.e . activ filter area , fluid veloc and microfilt geometri . weir-styl filter commun with a blood flow channel to separ plasma from blood move by capillari action . an expand downstream channel with multipl parallel capillari blood flow path provid continu movement of blood past the filter . lyse is control by the size of the filter pore and the durat of adher of the red blood cell to the pore . the control lysi or prevent of lysi of red blood cell is accomplish by manipul the signific capillari forc gener in the filter . filtrat , cell lysi and microchannel blood flow model are integr into an overal microfilt design use for fabric microfilt devic for lab-on-a-chip clinic applic where they can be coupl with on-chip electr and electro-opt devic .
