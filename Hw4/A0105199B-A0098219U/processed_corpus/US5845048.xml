applic recognit system for estim object condit a system for recogn an object state ( the kind , posit , attitud ) get observ object inform and recogn a natur occur object for which simpl rule can not be found . thi system output a state predict valu for a target object from cognit object observ data , an observ data predict valu for target partial featur accord to thi output , a partial featur predict posit in target observ result accord to a state evalu valu output , and recogn the object by modifi an output of the state predict valu output unit . mani natur occur object , for which simpl rule can not be found , can be model , and a recognit system , which can be use in more realist circumst , can be construct . an object base vision and an observ base vision as a 3d object model represent method is provid , and learn pattern necessari for recogn are obtain effect by use a visible-invis determin modul in automat obtain the 3d object model .
