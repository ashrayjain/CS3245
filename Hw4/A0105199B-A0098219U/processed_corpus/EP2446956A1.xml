method for gener mist and microbubbl use surfac acoust wave and devic for gener mist and microbubbl in a gener method and a gener of mist or fine-bubbl , with a simpl and small configur , applic into a wide rang kind of liquid is enabl , and gener stabli the mist or the fine-bubbl or both is enabl . the gener ( 1 ) is provid with a piezoelectr substrat ( 2 ) which equip two or more comb-lik electrod ( 21 ) on a surfac ( s ) and arrang so that the surfac ( s ) may intersect the mutual interfac ( 10a ) of the ga and the liquid ( 10 ) and a part of piezoelectr substrat ( 2 ) is put in a liquid ( 10 ) , and a surfac acoust wave w excit on the surfac ( s ) with the electrod ( 21 ) is made to propag along the surfac ( s ) so that may exist in the upper and lower side of an interfac ( 10a ) . the surfac acoust wave ( w ) gener mist ( m ) in the ga side which is abov the interfac ( 10a ) , and gener fine-bubbl ( b ) in the liquid ( 10 ) side which is below the interfac ( 10a ) . sinc the mist ( m ) and the fine-bubbl ( b ) are gener with the surfac acoust wave ( w ) , without be base on mechan oper for gener a turn stream , the mist ( m ) and the fine-bubbl ( b ) can be stabli gener in the simpl and small configur .
