hollow fiber membran sampl prepar devic simultan sampl purif , enrich and analysi of pharmaceut , illicit drug , pollut , biotechnolog product , synthet organ reaction product and food/flavor ingredi from complex matric can be perform use porou hollow fiber or porous-disk liquid-membran devic . the devic are part of a multi-wel ( e.g . 96-well ) plate . the devic can be use for select separ and enrich of complex mixtur contain trace level of analyt , and can be use in tandem with analyt instrument which routin handl multipl sampl under high throughput screen condit . a multi-well/multi-vi plate can into state-of-the-art hplc or gc sampl system or lc/m or gc/m instrument . sampl can be enrich sever order of magnitud and can directli be withdrawn from the fiber and inject into the chromatograph instrument . altern , these enrich sampl can be introduc directli into ms , ce or other detect devic . select extract of complex mixtur of analyt can be achiev through variat of acceptor phase chemistri , liquid membran coat , pore size control of the hollow fiber , natur of the polym from which the hollow fiber are made or ph of the acceptor phase .
