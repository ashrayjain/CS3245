process for the purif of an aqueou stream come from the fischer-tropsch reaction the present invent relat to a process for the purif of an aqueou stream come from the fischer-tropsch reaction which compris : feed the aqueou stream contain organ by product of the reaction to a fraction distil column or to a strip column ; -- condens of the vapor stream leav the head of the column and the remov of a distil enrich in the heaviest by-product ; -- feed the partial purifi aqueou stream leav the bottom of the distil column , at the head to one or more sensibl contact exchang ; -- send a process ga in countercurr to the tail of the exchang at a temperatur lower than that of the aqueou stream ; -- send the process ga enrich in water and part of the residu organ product leav the head of the exchang to the fischer-tropsch synthesi plant of hydrocarbon ; -- send the purifi colder water leav the exchang directli to further treatment .
