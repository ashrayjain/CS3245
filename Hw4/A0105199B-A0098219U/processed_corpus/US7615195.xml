photocatalyst water treat apparatu a photocatalyt water-process system decompos organ and inorgan materi present in water . the system includ a reservoir for store the water to be process , a main unit form separ and connect to the reservoir , an inlet pipe for guid the water from the reservoir to the main unit , an outlet pipe for return the water to the reservoir , and a pump for guid the water from the reservoir to the main unit and return the water . the reservoir ha an electrod unit therein for electrolyz the water so as to floccul and precipit the inorgan materi in the reservoir , and a filter is arrang within the main unit . also , a photocatalyt process devic is arrang within the main unit at a downstream side of the filter for decompos the organ materi in the absenc of scale form of the inorgan materi .
