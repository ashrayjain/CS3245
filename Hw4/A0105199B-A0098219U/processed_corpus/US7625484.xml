water treatment apparatu a water treatment apparatu ha a turbid meter , which is a detect part , for detect a gener state of bubbl in a micro/nano bubbl gener state confirm tank , as a turbid of treatment water . the water treatment apparatu also ha a control , which is a control part , for receiv an signal repres the turbid of treatment water detect by the turbid meter , to control open of air flow control valv in an interlock manner in respons to the signal , so that the amount of air flow through the control valv is automat control . the open of the air flow control valv are control in an interlock manner by the control in such a way that the signal repres turbid show that the treatment water within the confirm tank is white turbid ( i.e. , the turbid show not less than a specifi valu ) .
