remov of mercuri from coal via a microbi pretreat process a process for the remov of mercuri from coal prior to combust is disclos . the process is base on use of microorgan to oxid iron , sulfur and other speci bind mercuri within the coal , follow by volatil of mercuri by the microorgan . the microorgan are from a class of iron and/or sulfur oxid bacteria . the process involv contact coal with the bacteria in a batch or continu manner . the mercuri is first solubil from the coal , follow by microbi reduct to element mercuri , which is strip off by sparg ga and captur by a mercuri recoveri unit , give mercury-fre coal . the mercuri can be recov in pure form from the sorbent via addit process .
