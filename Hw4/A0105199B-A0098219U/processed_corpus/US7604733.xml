apparatu for biolog remov of phosphoru and nitrogen use granul methane-oxid bacteria a biolog remov method of phosphoru and nitrogen includ suppli a mixtur ga into a ga holder . inflow water and return water are suppli into the ga holder to make the mixtur ga dissolv in the inflow water and the return water . the return water wa provid from a granul biolog reaction tank . the inflow water and the return water includ the dissolv mixtur ga are transport to the granul biolog reaction tank . a nitrogen-bas compon is remov from the inflow water and the return water use methan-oxid bacteria granul in the granul biolog reaction tank . treat water without the nitrogen-bas compon is transport to an anox tank for treatment , and discharg from the anox tank .
