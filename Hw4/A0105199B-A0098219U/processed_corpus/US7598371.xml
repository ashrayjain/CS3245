nucleic acid separ use immobil metal affin chromatographi an immobil metal affin chromatographi ( imac ) method for separ and/or purifi compound contain a non-shield purin or pyrimidin moieti or group such as nucleic acid , presum through interact with the abund aromat nitrogen atom in the purin or pyrimidin moieti . the method can also be use to purifi compound contain purin or pyrimidin moieti where the purin and pyrimidin moieti are shield from interact with the column matrix from compound contain a non-shield purin or pyrimidin moieti or group . thu , double-strand plasmid and genom dna , which ha no low bind affin can be easili separ from rna and/or oligonucleotid which bind strongli to metal-charg chelat matric . imac column clarifi plasmid dna from bacteri alkalin lysat , purifi a ribozym , and remov primer and other contamin from pcr reaction . the metal ion affin of yeast rna decreas in the order : copper ( ii ) , nickel ( ii ) , zinc ( ii ) , and cobalt ( ii ) .
