fluid bed expans and fluidis method and apparatu in which a biomass is carri on a substrat that is fluidis . the fluidis substrat ha a layer of distributor particl below it , through which the fluidiz medium pass prior to contact with the fluidis substrat and biomass associ therewith . the effect of the distributor layer is that the particl damp out excess turbul in the fluidiz medium , thu prevent undu turbul of the medium within the fluidis layer . the particl may be recycl through the distributor layer to strip excess biofilm from the substrat particl prior to return the substrat particl to the fluidis bed .
