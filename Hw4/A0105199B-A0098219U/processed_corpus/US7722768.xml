process for the simultan remov of bod and phosphat from wast water the invent is direct to a process for the simultan remov of bod and phosphat from a liquid contain ammonium , bod , phosphat and magnesium , the method compris : feed the liquid to a reactor contain bod-oxidis biomass ; ensur that the liquid in the reactor contain an excess to stoichiometri of ammonium and magnesium rel to phosphat , wherein the stoichiometri is relat to the stoichiometri of struvit ; oxidis at least part of the bod ; adjust the ph of the liquid in the reactor at a desir valu ; form solid materi in the reactor , the solid materi compris struvit ; separ at least part of the solid materi from the reactor effluent ; return a part of the solid materi to the reactor . the invent is also direct to a reactor for thi process . the advantag of the process and the apparatu is that in one reactor both bod and phosphat are remov from the liquid .
