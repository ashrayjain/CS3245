super sound engine/transmiss sound enhanc the present invent relat to an electron engin sound duplic simul use in combin with an intern combust motor , a batteri , and an altern . the sound duplic simul includ a motor rpm sensor , a sound duplic microprocessor , an amplifi , a sound trim adjust and a switch . when the intern combust engin is power , the microprocessor convert the rpm signal into a frequenc modul electr signal which gener a sound simul that of a high perform vehicl . the sound trim adjust prevent the frequenc modul electr signal from be transmit to the speaker mean when there is a predetermin low motor rpm . the stitch is mount on the dashboard of a vehicl for turn the microprocessor and amplifi on and off .
