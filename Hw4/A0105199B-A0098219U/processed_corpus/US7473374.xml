fluid treatment apparatu an apparatu is provid that introduc rapidli spin vortic in a fluid , includ water . it incorpor a fluid system , or fluid sourc , with a vortex creation apparatu and a frequenc gener devic . the vortic prepar the fluid to have memor electromagnet frequenc signatur of harm materi eras , and a new , desir signatur introduc . the desir frequenc can be introduc though a number of mean , such as electr , sound wave , and magnet field , use such devic as power lead , speaker , transduc , and magnet . frequenc from desir materi can also be appli by contact the fluid with the materi , such as metal strand of copper and silver . the desir frequenc make the fluid an inhospit environ for the biolog contamin , such as bacteria , alga , and fungi , reduc their number in the fluid . the fluid may be pass through a plural of magnet micro-spher to interact with the water molecul to polar miner salt prevent the format of deposit on the insid of relat plumb .
