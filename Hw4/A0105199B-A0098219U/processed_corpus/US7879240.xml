method and system for aerat wastewat for re-us a method and apparatu for aerat a liquid , particularli for aerat water in a wastewat treatment process , by : introduc the liquid into a primari pressuriz aerat tank ; pump liquid from the primari pressuriz aerat tank into a secondari pressuriz aerat chamber via a feed path ; aerat the liquid in the secondari pressuriz aerat chamber ; and recircul aerat liquid from the secondari pressuriz aerat chamber back to the primari pressuriz aerat tank via a return path . the return path ha a cross-sect area smaller than that of the feed path through which the liquid is pump into the secondari pressuriz aerat chamber such as to pressur the secondari pressuriz aerat chamber to a pressur greater than that in the primari pressuriz aerat tank , and therebi ( a ) to enhanc the aerat of the liquid in the secondari pressuriz aerat chamber , and ( b ) to suppli the energi for recircul the aerat liquid back to the primari pressuriz aerat tank .
