system and method for remov or reduc pollut in exhaust gase gase contain smoke , pollut and volatil organ compound ( voc 's ) and a mix liquid are blend in a swirl vortex into a liquid/ga mixtur . motiv air and biolog and/or chemic degrad materi are introduc through a plural of spiral jet fluid mixer into the liquid/ga mixtur to creat a turbul fluid flow pattern to caus aerat of the liquid/ga mixtur , reduc it chemic oxygen demand ( cod ) , and entrain the biolog and/or chemic degrad materi in the mixtur . the biolog and/or chemic degrad materi significantli reduc or elimin the pollut and volatil organ compound ( voc 's ) in the aerat liquid/ga mixtur to produc a non-volatil liquid , which flow into a reservoir , hold pond or veget pond . a portion of the aerat non-volatil liquid may be conduct to a pond contain veget growth to complet carbon dioxid convers via photosynthesi , and veget growth from the pond may be harvest .
