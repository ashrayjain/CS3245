method for processing/wash with ultra-pur water plasma foam and apparatu for the method [ problem ] to provid : a quit novel method for processing/wash a materi with ultra-pur water plasma foam , which enabl the process or wash of the surfac of the materi under ultra-clean environ by util plasma gener in ultra-pur water ; and an apparatu for the method . [ mean for solv problem ] a materi ( 6 ) to be treat is place in ultra-pur water . the ultra-pur water is irradi with ultrason wave to gener fine air bubbl and , at the same time , is also irradi with an electromagnet wave have a high frequenc continu with focus on the air bubbl to therebi gener plasma in the air bubbl . the surfac ( 7 ) of the materi ( 6 ) can be process or wash by suppli the air bubbl ( 5 ) have the plasma gener therein , air bubbl gener after disrupt of the plasma , or activ radic gener after disrupt of the air bubbl onto the surfac .
