ultraviolet water purif system an ultraviolet-c ( uvc ) base portabl water purif system employ a novel array of baffl increas the effici per unit energi of irradi uvc light in the erad of pathogen in the water . close loop feedback allow monitor the applic of uvc light power to ensur high level of pathogen erad . thi system is capabl of erad a wide rang of waterborn bacteria , virus , protozoa , helminth , yeast , and mold found in natur freshwat sourc worldwid . by ad pre- or post-filt , the system can remov harm organ compound , pesticid , inorgan compound and heavi metal from the water . the system can also be use to erad pathogen in fluid other than water . as a featur of thi invent , a commun system that can reach geograph dispers popul at low cost without the need to instal costli wire commun infrastructur is combin with and power by the water purif system . in one embodi , a packet radio system is provid to creat node in a wireless mesh commun system to provid voic , data , video and internet commun use an array of the water purifi to creat a wireless mesh network .
