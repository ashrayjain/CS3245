system for predict reduct in concentr of a target materi in a flow of fluid an ultraviolet fluid treatment system have feedback control use a kinet model and a reactor model that interact with one anoth . the kinet model use readili measur fluid properti upstream and downstream of a radiat zone to calcul the convers of a target contamin as it pass through the fluid treatment system . thi obviat the need to measur the contamin concentr directli , which gener is too slow to permit real-tim control . a reactor model relat system oper cost to system oper paramet , such as electr power consumpt and/or rate of oxid addit , where applic . the reactor model is link to the kinet model and is use to optim oper cost by adjust system oper paramet base on a comparison between the convers obtain from the kinet model and the overal treatment object . a control center , an ultraviolet fluid treatment apparatu , and a method of treat a fluid are also disclos .
