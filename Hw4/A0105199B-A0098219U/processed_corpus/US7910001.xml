arrang of denitrif reactor in a recircul aquacultur system the present invent relat to a novel arrang of denitrif reactor for remov of nitrat compound in a recircul aquacultur system . the novel arrang of an aquacultur system of the present invent includ posit one or more anaerob denitrif reactor upstream of aerob nitrif and degass process . one aspect of the present invent includ a flow of aqueou medium from aquat speci rear tank toward one or more denitrif reactor . anoth aspect of the present invent includ flow of aqueou medium from aquat speci rear tank to a solid remov filter or mechan filtrat mean for remov of solid wast matter or biomass prior to flow of aqueou medium toward one or more denitrif reactor . in a sequenc of compon compris a system of the present invent , treat and denitrifi aqueou medium exit one or more denitrif reactor is direct toward a solid remov filter wherein treat and denitrifi aqueou medium combin with untreat aqueou medium . combin untreat aqueou medium and denitrifi aqueou medium exit a solid remov filter and is direct toward an aerob nitrif unit . aqueou medium exit the aerob nitrif unit is degass and oxygen and return to aquat speci rear tank . a system of the present invent which util denitrif reactor posit upstream of aerob nitrif ha advantag over exist aquacultur system which use denitrif in reduct of nitrat concentr . thi result in greater mitig of water chemistri and compound which are harm to aquat speci and more effici use and conserv of water resourc .
