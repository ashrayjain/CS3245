method of biofiltr of a liquid effluent a method of biofiltr of a liquid effluent by simultan nitrif and denitrif use the ad of an oxygen sourc at a predetermin rate and option the ad of a carbon sourc ( such as whey ) thu enabl the complet transform of the nitrat ( no.sub.3 ) present in the effluent at the time of treatment through a biofilt . the specif oper condit favor the simultan nitrif and denitrif includ the control inject of a slight quantiti of air , adjust of the level of nitrogen load ( tkn+no.sub.3 ) and the level of carbon load therebi make possibl elimin for the most part of the releas of unwant nitrogen in the form of no.sub.3 or no.sub.2 .
