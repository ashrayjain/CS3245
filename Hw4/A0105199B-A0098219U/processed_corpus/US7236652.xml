imag retriev apparatu and imag retriev method an object of the present invent is to provid an imag retriev system for comput similar in the case when compon are differ between an imag featur vector of a queri imag and the imag featur vector of imag to be retriev when retriev is carri out by use featur of imag . a first imag featur vector convers devic convert a queri imag featur vector into a first imag featur vector for use in a similar comput accord to similar comput imag featur vector configur inform describ a given configur of an imag featur vector for use in a similar comput . a second imag featur vector convers devic convert an images-to-be-retriev featur vector into a second imag featur vector for use in a similar comput accord to the similar comput imag featur vector configur inform . the imag featur vector similar comput devic compar the first imag featur vector with the second imag featur vector accord to the similar comput imag featur vector configur inform , and comput the similar .
