method and devic incorpor granular particl and disc-shap plastic pellet for filter water a novel water flow facilit for granular filter devic that oper under graviti and contain granular particl , further consist of plastic pellet that are 2 to 100 time , prefer 5 to 20 time larger than the granular particl ; the plastic pellet have an aspect ratio of 0.5 to 10 , prefer 1 to 4 ; that compris about 1 to 50 % , prefer 5 to 15 % of the weight of the filter media ; that have a specif graviti of 0.5 to 2 , prefer 0.9 to 1.5 . the plastic pellet should contain antimicrobi agent that protect the granular media from microbiolog growth . the plastic pellet are made from ani of the follow plastic : polyolefin , variou kind of polyacryl , polyvinyl polym , nylon , polycarbon etc . the plastic pellet may contain filler such as calcium carbon , titania , silica , or alumina . the invent flow facilit is util in a graviti fed granular filter devic to remov contamin such as chlorin , tast and odor-caus compound , solvent , pesticid , dissolv organ impur , dissolv heavi metal and non-metal impur such as perchlor . the invent flow facilit is util in a graviti fed granular filter devic in which the media consist of activ carbon , synthet ion exchang resin , silica , alumina , titania , green sand , iron oxid or mixtur thereof .
