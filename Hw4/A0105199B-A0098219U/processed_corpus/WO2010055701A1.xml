microbubbl gener mechan a microbubbl gener mechan is provid with a collis member ( 22 ) project from the inner surfac of a flow passag wall ( 25 ) , and also with a gap form section ( 23 ) form in a flow passag ( fp ) so as to be oppos to the front end , with respect to the direct of the project , of the collis member ( 22 ) . a bypass flow passag ( 251 ) is form between the outer peripher surfac of the collis member ( 22 ) and the inner surfac of the flow passag wall ( 25 ) . a restrict gap ( 21g ) is form between the collis member ( 22 ) and the gap form section ( 23 ) . the restrict gap ( 21g ) restrict flow of water so that the water flow through the restrict gap ( 21g ) at a lower flow rate and a higher flow speed than when flow through the water bypass flow passag ( 251 ) . owe to the construct abov , the microbubbl gener mechan can gener a suffici amount of bubbl without use a complex air-liquid mix mechan and can break up bubbl into finer microbubbl with greatli enhanc effect . as a result , the microbubbl gener mechan can gener a larg amount of bubbl , which are in a micro bubbl region or a micro-nano bubbl region , at a level which ha not been achiev by convent product .
