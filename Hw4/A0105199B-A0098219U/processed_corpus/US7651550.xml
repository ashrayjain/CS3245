method for sulfur compound remov from contamin ga and liquid stream a desorpt process and a process for produc a catalyt deactiv form zeolit adsorb , wherebi both process are suitabl to improv the lifetim of a form zeolit adsorb in the remov of sulfur compound from sulfur contamin ga and liquid feed stream . the adsorb is in particular a synthet 13x or lsx faujasit with a silica to alumina ratio from 1.9:1.0 to about 3.0:1.0 . the cation of the faujasit includ alkali and alkalin earth metal . the form zeolit mixtur is prefer catalyt deactiv due to a phosphat treatment . the desorpt is carri out thermal , wherein the heat treatment is done at differ temperatur stage to avoid decomposit of the organ sulfur compound .
