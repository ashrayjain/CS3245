method use membran bioreactor with reduc air scour requir in a sewag treatment plant with a membran bioreactor ( mbr ) , raw untreat or partial treat wastewat ( influent ) and/or mix liquor in the intensifi process is superoxygen . in a prefer form of the process the influent is superoxygen such that membran air scour requir are reduc . influent may be fed to a swing zone where denitrif and nitrif occur simultan through process control . in one embodi superoxygen is conduct in an intern recycl stream of the mix liquor , with oxygen content supersatur prefer to over 300 part per million . due to the activ evolut of oxygen ga from the supersatur stream , occur prefer by seed the supersatur stream with air bubbl , the supersatur oxygen can serv the dual purpos of meet process oxygen demand and provid part of air scour requir for the membran .
