method of clarifi industri wastewat for the reduct of organ wast content use cation dispers polym combin with powder activ carbon and anion floccul polym a method is provid for clarifi wastewat contain contamin includ solubl organ compound and insolubl organ compound . the wastewat is treat with a pacul admixtur includ a cation coagul polym and powder activ carbon . the cation coagul polym is polydiallydimethylammonium chlorid , poli quaternari amin , and/or a starch-bas organ polym . after an at least 2 second delay , a floccul is ad to the wastewat to achiev ( i ) microcoagul of the cation coagul polym with the contamin to form coagul particl have an effect mass and cation charg to react with an anion floccul to be ad thereaft , and ( ii ) absorpt of the solubl organ compound on the powder activ carbon . the anion floccul as ad and react with the coagul particl to form a sludg , contain agglomer particl includ the coagul particl and powder activ carbon , of suffici size for mechan remov . the sludg is remov to provid clarifi wastewat .
