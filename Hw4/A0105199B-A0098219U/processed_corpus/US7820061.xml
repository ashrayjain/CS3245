titanium oxid and alumina alkali metal composit the invent relat to group 1 metal/por metal oxid composit compris porou metal oxid select from porou titanium oxid and porou alumina and an alkali metal or an alkali metal alloy . the composit of the invent are describ as stage 0 and i materi . these materi differ in their prepar and chemic reactiv . each success stage may be prepar directli use the method describ below or from an earlier stage materi . stage 0 materi may , for exampl , be prepar use liquid alloy of na and k which are rapidli absorb by porou metal oxid under isotherm condit , prefer at or just abov room temperatur , to form loos black powder that retain much of the reduc abil of the parent metal . when the low melt group 1 metal are absorb into the porou metal oxid at about 150.degre . c. , an exotherm reaction produc stage i materi , loos black powder that are stabl in dri air . further heat form higher stage materi of unknown composit . it is believ that stage i higher materi repres reduct of the porou metal oxid after absorpt of the group 1 metal . prefer group 1 metal/por metal oxid composit of the invent are those contain sodium , potassium , or sodium-potassium alloy with sodium and sodium-potassium alloy be most prefer . each stage of the group 1 metal/por metal oxid composit of the invent may be use as a reduc agent react with a number of reduc organ materi in the same manner known for alkali metal and their alloy .
