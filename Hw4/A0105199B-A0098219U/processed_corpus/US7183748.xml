electr charger and power suppli devic for portabl termin a charg control unit decid the number of batteri cell on the basi of an output voltag of a batteri pack , and an output voltag of a charg circuit is determin in accord with the decid number of batteri cell . even though suppli of an extern power suppli is detect , when a batteri connect is not detect , the power suppli circuit of the charg control unit is set in a stop state . in addit , when disconnect of the batteri is detect , a cancel voltag for cancel a cutoff state caus by overdischarg of the batteri is output . in a power suppli devic for a portabl termin , a capacitor electr charg by an output voltag of main dc/dc convert is connect as an auxiliari power suppli of a backup dc/dc convert to make exchang of the auxiliari batteri unnecessari .
