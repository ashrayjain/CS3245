method for extract at least one compound from a liquid phase compris a function ionic liquid , and microfluid system for implement said method a method for extract at least one chemic or biolog compound from a liquid phase includ at least one function ionic liquid , via a liquid extract fluid that is miscibl with the ionic liquid , and a microfluid system implement the method . the extract method includ move , on one surfac of a microfluid system , at least one microdrop of the liquid phase into an extract solut that includ the extract fluid and that is local on the surfac to obtain in output of the solut , under effect of an electr field , an extract move away from the surfac that is rich in extract fluid and enrich in the at least one compound , and a raffin move on the surfac that is rich in ionic liquid and delet in the at least one compound .
