pressurizing-depressur cycl for remov of contamin in environment sampl a method of remov contamin from slurri sampl is set forth . the method includ the util of repeat pressur and depressur step to disrupt solidifi particl in solid-contain slurri therebi increas decontamin effici . an expans fluid is inject into the slurri sampl suffici to creat microbubbl when the slurri sampl is depressur . the micro bubbl mechan disrupt the solidifi particl increas contamin exposur . the microbubbl also provid for increas interfaci region where contamin can accumul at gas-liquid thin film that are in close proxim to and can be effect remov use a suitabl expans fluid and option decontamin agent .
