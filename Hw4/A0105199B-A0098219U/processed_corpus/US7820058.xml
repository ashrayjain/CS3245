method of enhanc fine particl dewat a new method of improv the process of dewat fine particul materi is disclos . in thi method , an aqueou slurri of fine particl is treat with appropri hydrophob reagent so that the particul materi becom moder hydrophob with it water contact angl consider below 90.degree.. a low hydrophile-lipophil balanc ( hlb ) number surfact is then ad to the slurri , so that the surfact molecul adsorb on the moder hydrophob surfac primarili by hydrophob attract and , therebi , increas it contact angl close to or abov 90.degree.. by virtu of the greatli enhanc hydrophob , the water molecul adher to the surfac are destabil and remov more readili by a mechan dewat process . ani nonion surfact with it hlb number below about 15 may be use for the hydrophob enhanc . the surfact may be use in conjunct with appropri solvent such as light hydrocarbon oil and short-chain alcohol . the moistur reduct can be further improv by use appropri electrolyt in conjunct with the low hlb surfact , spray surfac tension lower reagent onto the filter cake , subject the cake to a suitabl vibratori mean , and by use combin thereof .
