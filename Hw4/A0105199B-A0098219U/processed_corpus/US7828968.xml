method and apparatu for imag target compon in a biolog sampl use perman magnet a system for enumer of cell in fluid by imag cytometri is describ for assess of target popul such as leukocyt subset in differ bodili fluid or bacteri contamin in environment sampl , food product and bodili fluid . briefli , fluoresc label target cell are link to magnet particl or bead . in one embodi , a small , perman magnet is insert directli into the chamber contain the label cell . the magnet are coat with pdm silicon rubber to provid a smooth and even surfac which allow imag on a singl focal plane . the magnet is remov from the sampl and illumin with fluoresc light emit by the target cell captur by a ccd camera . in anoth embodi , a floater have a perman magnet allow the target cell to line up along a singl imag plane within the sampl solut . imag analysi can be perform with a novel algorithm to provid a count of the cell on the surfac , reflect the target cell concentr of the origin sampl .
