process for recov platinum group metal , rhenium and gold process for the extract of metal consist of platinum , palladium , iridium , rhodium , osmium , ruthenium , rhenium and gold ( pgmra ) includ dissolut of the pgmra metal from solid materi in an acid aqueou solut , prefer with a halogen acid sparg with the correspond halogen element . the acid solut is then expos to extract materi of non-cross-link polyamin composit resin . the bound metal , follow wash of the extract materi is elut from the resin use stronger acid process than that provid in the wash of the resin . convent extract by organ solvent or other known techniqu is employ to recov the pgmra metal . rhodium is separ from the rest of the pgmra metal either near the begin or the end of the process . rhodium is separ by creat hydroxid with the metal in the solut and then reacidifi the metal such that the rhodium remain as aquochlororhod complex . use the bind process to the extract materi leav onli the aquochlororhod complex in solut to be recov . all of the pgmra metal may be recov by convent mean such as organ solvent , reduct or precipit .
