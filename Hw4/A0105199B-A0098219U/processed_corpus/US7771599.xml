system and method for use carbon dioxid sequest from seawat in the reminer of process water disclos is an improv method for the reminer of process water in a desalin system . the method sequest carbon dioxid ga ( co.sub.2 ) from seawat or concentr ( brine ) of desalin process via a ga transfer membran . the sequest carbon dioxid ga ( co.sub.2 ) is thereaft use in the product of solubl calcium bicarbon ( ca ( hco.sub.3 ) .sub.2 ) . the calcium bicarbon ( ca ( hco.sub.3 ) .sub.2 ) add hard and alkalin to the result process water .
