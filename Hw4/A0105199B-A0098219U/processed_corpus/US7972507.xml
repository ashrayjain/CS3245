advanc wastewat treatment process use up and down aerobic/anaerob reactor of channel type an apparatu for advanc wastewat treatment use up & down aerobic-anaerob reactor of channel type in the singl reaction tank provid the effluent recycl of channel type aerat reactor ( intern cycl ) . for thi , the anaerob reactor of channel type is under the aerob reactor of channel type in the singl reaction tank . and the flow of the wastewat in the singl reaction tank is base on the water level differ between inlet and outlet , and the air lift effect of the air diffus . the partit of channel type anaerob reactor and the partit of channel type aerob reactor are cross each other . consequ , the energi cost is cut down becaus the wastewat flow doe not need much pump energi . and the site need is reduc becaus of up & down aerobic-anaerob reactor of channel type in the singl reaction tank .
