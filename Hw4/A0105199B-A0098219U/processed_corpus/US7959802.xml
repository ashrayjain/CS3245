water purif system a water purif system perform a water purif process through physic steril , and at least includ a compress devic and a decompress devic . water is convert into a high-pressur liquid through the compress devic , and then is convert into a high-spe fluid by control the cross-sect area of a spout of the decompress devic , thu gener physic effect such as pressur drop and shear stress , so as to damag cell wall of bacteria in the liquid to die-off the bacteria . therefor , purifi water is obtain .
