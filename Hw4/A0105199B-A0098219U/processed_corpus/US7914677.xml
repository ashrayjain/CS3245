water treatment apparatu and water treatment method water ( 23 ) that contain micro-nano bubbl gener in a micro-nano bubbl gener tank ( 6 ) is introduc and treat in a charcoal water tank ( ii ) which is fill with a charcoal ( 15 ) and in which an air diffus pipe ( 12 ) is place and thereaft introduc and treat in a membran devic ( 21 ) . thu , activ of microorgan propag in the charcoal ( 15 ) are increas by the micro-nano bubbl , markedli increas abil of decompos organ matter in the water . therefor , a clog phenomenon due to the organ matter can be prevent by reduc organ load on the membran devic ( 21 ) . moreov , a veri small amount of alcohol or salt are ad as a micro-nano bubbl gener aid to the micro-nano bubbl gener tank ( 6 ) , improv an incid rate of the micro-nano bubbl . the alcohol and salt are easili decompos by the charcoal water tank ( ii ) and easili remov by the membran devic ( 21 ) .
