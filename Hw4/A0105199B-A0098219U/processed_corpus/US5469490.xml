cold-cathod x-ray emitt and tube therefor a light weight batteri power x-ray sourc capabl of produc high intens x-ray emiss with low power consumpt . a modular construct locat all high voltag compon includ the x-ray tube , spark gap trigger , spiral capacitor and the secondari of a step-up transform in a seal canist which can be decoupl both mechan and electr by unscrew a simpl thread coupl . a center modul contain the primari of the step-up transform , circuit board for electron compon and a puls counter/selector . a batteri pack with recharg nicad batteri is remov connect to the center modul . high intens puls are achiev in part by connect the spiral capacitor at midlength to the spark gap trigger . an improv x-ray tube with light weight but effect lead shield and an overal length of less than two inch is also disclos .
