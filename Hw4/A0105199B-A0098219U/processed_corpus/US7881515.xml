cephalogram imag analysi method an autom cephalogram imag analysi method is disclos . in thi method , a step is first perform for build a refer databas in which a set of trace featur curv model respect repres a set of refer cephalometr pattern are establish base on a set of trace record . then , a step of pattern comparison and analysi is perform . in thi step , at least one cephalogram is first input , and then a step is perform for compar the imag of the cephalogram with the trace featur curv model , therebi select at least one cephalometr pattern and at least one featur curv model belong to the cephalometr pattern from the refer cephalometr pattern and the trace featur curv model . thereaft , the featur curv model is fit to the imag of the cephalogram so as to obtain at least one trace of the at least one cephalogram .
