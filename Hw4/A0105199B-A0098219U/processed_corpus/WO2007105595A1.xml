batteri state judg devic provid is a batteri state judg devic , which can judg the batteri state of a lead batteri precis from an engin start voltag while consid the influenc of the temperatur of a vehicl . on the basi of an open circuit voltag ( ocv ) and the temperatur of the vehicl , an engin start voltag ( vst1 ) correct from an engin start voltag ( vst ) of the lead batteri at the engin start time is comput ( at s112 ) . a batteri decid voltag ( vst_th ) express the voltag of the lead batteri at the engin start time when the increas factor of the intern resist of the lead batteri reach a predetermin valu for the batteri replac is comput ( at s126 ) from the open circuit voltag ( ocv ) . the batteri state of the lead batteri is decid ( at s132 ) by judg whether or not the engin start voltag ( vst1 ) belong to a predetermin zone of a characterist map . the engin start voltag ( vst1 ) is comput by assum that temperatur of the lead batteri , which is measur after laps of a predetermin time from an engin stop , as the temperatur of the vehicl .
