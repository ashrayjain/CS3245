contamin remov method for a bodi of water pollut , such as heavi metal , phosphoru , and pathogen organ , are remov from water by ad a chemic coagul to water within an enclosur . with mix , coagul and floccul occur , and a floc contain the pollut settl to the enclosur bottom ; so the treat water abov the floc is free from at least some of the pollut . some of the treat water is remov from the enclosur , and new water is ad . the new water and the settl floc are mix to resuspend floc compon . the process is repeat until the floc no longer exhibit contaminant-remov capabl . in an altern system , a matrix element is deploy within the enclosur , which captur a portion of the floc that settl within the water column . pollut in new water ad to the enclosur encount these suspend floc particl and are subsequ remov from the water .
