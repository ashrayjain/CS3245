method for determin the concentr of asymmetr dimethylarginin ( adma ) the invent relat to a method for determin the concentr of asymmetr dimethylarginin ( adma ) simultan with arginin and with symmetr dimethylarginin ( sdma ) in biolog sampl by mean of hplc-ms-m . the sampl prepar consist exclus of ad a solut of isotope-label intern standard ( .sup.13c.sub.6-arginin and d.sub.6-adma ) and of ad a mixtur consist of acetonitrile/propion acid/trifluoroacet acid for precipit high-molecular protein , the quantiti and composit be realiz in such a manner that a bring of the sampl composit in line with the composit of the mobil phase in the hplc separ is achiev without requir a derivit or extract of the analyt . the chromatograph separ of the analyt ensu on a silica normal phase hplc column while use a mobil phase consist of water/acetonitrile/propion acid/trifluoroacet acid , the volum ratio of water to acetonitril rang from 2 to 98 to 30 to 70 , the volum percent of trifluoroacet acid rang from 0.01 to 0.5 , the volum percent of propion acid be 10 to 100 time higher than trifluoroacet acid , and the optim composit of the mobil phase consist of acetonitrile/propion acid/trifluoroacet acid with 10/90/1/0.025 volum percent . the detect and quantif ensu by mean of tandem mass spectrometri with the follow fragment be observ : 175.2 m/z.fwdarw.70.1 m/z for arginin , 181.2 m/z.fwdarw.74.1 m/z for .sup.13c.sub.6-arginin , 203.2 m/z.fwdarw.172.1 m/z for sdma , 203.2 m/z.fwdarw.46.1 m/z for adma and 209.2 m/z.fwdarw.70.1 m/z d.sub.6-adma .
