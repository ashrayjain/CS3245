ceram flexibl membran provid improv adhes to the support fleec the present invent relat to flexibl ceram membran which , depend on embodi , are use as separ for batteri , especi lithium batteri , and also a process for their product . ceram or hybrid membran have the disadvantag that , whatev the level of flexibl alreadi achiev , they tend to crumbl off the ceram coat on bend . thi is prevent by the present membran , which compris , on and in a polymer nonwoven , a solidifi ceram coat which is construct from two fraction of metal oxid particl of differ size and which adher to the polymer nonwoven through a network construct by two differ adhes promot .
