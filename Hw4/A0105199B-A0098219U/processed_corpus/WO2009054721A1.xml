track system for move object , usual anim , mainli migratori bird and in particular carrier pigeon the invent relat to a track system for track the posit of move object , mainli anim and especi migratori bird and in particular carrier pigeon ( 11 ) . the track system is base on an electron devic that is provid with a radio transceiv oper in the gsm network . by thi mean a uniqu identif code such as a telephon number or registr number can be atransmit via the gsm network ( 16 ) to the server ( 15 ) . as energi sourc , the electron devic use a zinc-air batteri that can be attach to or detach from the electron devic by a snap connect . it is worth note that the electron devic can be switch on and off with the aid of an incorpor rfid chip when thi is activ by an rfid scanner . the electron devic weigh less than 10 gram so that the bearer of the electron devic , for exampl , a carrier pigeon is hardli weigh down . the electron devic is water-tight . the chip in the electron devic are fabric on a basi of hafnium and are interconnect by mean of a wafer-level packag techniqu .
