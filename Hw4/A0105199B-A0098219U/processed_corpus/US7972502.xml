aeration-less water treatment apparatu an aeration-less water treatment apparatu includ an anaerob reactor which receiv sewag to caus the sewag to flow as an upward stream , and an aerob reactor which receiv treat water from the anaerob reactor to caus the water to flow as a downward stream so that the water contact aerob microorgan and air to aerob treat the pollut matter in the water , the apparatu further includ a suspend sludg section locat in a lower part of the anaerob reactor and in which the anaerob microorgan are suspend in the sewag , and a carrier section locat in an upper part of the anaerob reactor and have carrier to which the anaerob microorgan are attach , the anaerob microorgan have flow from the suspend sludg section be further attach to the carrier .
