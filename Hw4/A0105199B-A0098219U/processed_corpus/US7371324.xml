chemic process a process for extract from aqueou solut the alkali metal or ammonium salt of a phenol , naphthol , anthrol or phenanthrol or the correspond thiol , which compris contact an aqueou alkalin or neutral solut of the alkali metal or ammonium salt , in which is dissolv an alkali metal or ammonium fluorid , chlorid , bromid , hydroxid , nitrat , nitrit , sulphat , sulphit , sulphid , thiosulph , phosphat , hydrogen phosphat , carbon , bicarbon , cyanat , cyanid , thiocyan , borat , chlorat , chlorit , hypochlorit , perchlor , chromat , dichrom or permangan , with a partial water-misc organ solvent so as to transfer aqueou solut of the alkali metal or ammonium salt of the phenol , naphthol , anthrol or phenanthrol or correspond thiol into the solvent while retain separ aqueou and solvent phase , and thereaft separ the solvent phase contain the alkali metal or ammonium salt and water from the aqueou phase , the ratio of solvent to water in the separ solvent phase be from 0.5:1 to 10:1 w/w .
