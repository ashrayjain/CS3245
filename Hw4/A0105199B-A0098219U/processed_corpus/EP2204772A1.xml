imag process method , imag process program , imag process devic , and imag devic an object of the present invent is to detect motion between plural imag with high precis without increas the number of block made by divid an imag . thu , an image-process method accord to the present invent is character by includ a search step ( s3 ) of search for a local motion vector from each of block in the plural imag , an elect step ( s4 ) of elect a repres motion vector from the local motion vector of the respect block , and an approxim step ( s5 ) of approxim a motion vector distribut on the imag base on the repres motion vector . in addit , when an approxim surfac thereof is a plane , the oper amount for approxim the motion vector distribut and the inform amount for repres the motion vector distribut can be minim .
