fingerprint featur correl a devic , and a method for it oper , for verifi a person 's ident by compar in a correl ( 18 ) select featur of a refer fingerprint imag , gener in a sensor ( 10 ) from the fingerprint of a person of known ident , with a subject fingerprint imag taken from a person whose ident is to be verifi . in an enrol procedur , a fingerprint from a person of known ident is analyz in an enrol processor ( 14 ) to locat multipl refer patch that togeth are distinct to that person 's fingerprint . the refer patch imag are store , togeth with their locat in the imag , in a refer imag storag unit ( 16 ) . when a subject fingerprint imag is later provid , everi refer patch is compar with everi possibl patch of similar size in the subject imag , to find a set of candid match locat in the subject imag . then a subset of the candid match locat is select such that the candid match locat in the subset are practic geometr congruent with the locat of a correspond subset of refer patch . a verif match is declar base on the number candid match locat in the select subset that satisfi thi geometr constraint .
