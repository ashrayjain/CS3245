imag retriev method , imag retriev program , and imag registr method an imag retriev method compris : a step of extract at least one queri featur vector from a queri imag on which a subject of the imag retriev is captur , the queri featur vector repres a local featur of the queri imag ; a step of access an imag data base in which a plural of refer imag are store previous , each refer imag be store in conjunct with learn imag gener therefrom and refer featur vector repres local featur of the refer imag and the learn imag ; a compar step of compar the queri featur vector with the refer featur vector store in conjunct with each refer imag use an approxim nearest neighbor search to find a refer featur vector approxim nearest to the queri featur vector ; and a select step of select a refer imag with which the found refer featur vector is store in conjunct from the refer imag as a retriev result wherein : the learn imag is gener by ad a defocu and/or a motion-blur effect like to occur on captur the subject to each refer imag , the refer featur vector are extract from each refer imag and the learn imag correspond to the refer imag respect use the scale-spac approach , the queri featur vector is extract from the queri imag use the scale-spac approach , and each of the abov step is execut by a comput .
